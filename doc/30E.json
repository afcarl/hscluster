Roussos went on to become a global superstar with his solo hits Forever and Ever, Mr Reason, Goodbye My Love, Goodbye, Velvet Mornings, Lovely Lady Of Arcadia and Quand je t'aime. His theatrical figure, with a flowing dark beard, intense dark eyes and long hair thinning on top, became one of the musical faces of the Seventies.\n\nHe was also a member of progressive rock group Aphrodite's Child, joining up with Vangelis Papatanassiou and Loukas Sideras. Their association became one of the biggest musical events of the Seventies.\n\nRoussos was caught up in one of the major news events of the Eighties when on June 14 1985, while he was among 153 people travelling from Athens to Rome, his TWA Flight 847 was hijacked by two Shiite Muslim militiamen. Roussos and his third wife were held as prisoners and he spent his 39th birthday on the plane. He was released unharmed five days later, and at a press conference thanked his captors for giving him a birthday cake.\n\nRoussos also guested on the soundtrack to Blade Runner (1982), with a song entitled Tales Of The Future.\n\nHis final album, Demis, was released in 2009 and produced by Marc di Domenico. It had been recorded at the State of the Ark Studios, a studio in London which specialised in retro and vintage recording equipment and gear.\n\nRoussos had long struggled with his weight (at one time he was 319 pounds/145 kilograms), and in latter years suffered ill-health that kept him chair-bound.\n\nOne of his last public appearances was in Athens in 2013, when he received a French Legion of Honour medal for his life's work.\n\nFor British music lovers, many will cherish the singer's warbling grace on Forever and Ever \u2013 and the priceless argument in the Mike Leigh TV drama Abigail's Party over who wants to listen to Demis Roussos.\n\nDemis Roussos performs at Istiqlol Palace in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 2012 GETTY IMAGES\n\n\n\nDemis Roussos - Forever And Ever on MUZU.TV.", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/11369568/Demis-Roussos-singer-dies.html", "published": 1422230400.0, "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03176/Demis-Roussos2_3176809k.jpg"}, {"title": "Demis Roussos, Greek singer of Forever and Ever, dies aged 68", "body": "Demis Roussos, the Greek pop and rock singer who became an unlikely international star in the 70s and 80s, famed for his soaring, high-pitched voice and voluminous kaftans, has died aged 68.\n\nThe death of Roussos, who had a No 1 UK single in 1976 with Forever and Ever, was confirmed by the Hygeia hospital in Athens, the BBC reported. He had been receiving treatment for some time for an undisclosed illness, the BBC said.\n\nRoussos, who also had notable solo hits with Goodbye and Quand Je T\u2019Aime, was viewed as something of a kitsch figure during his heyday, an image cemented by Mike Leigh\u2019s 1977 BBC TV play Abigail\u2019s Party, in which Alison Steadman\u2019s social-climbing party host tries to impress her guests with her fondness for the singer.\n\nNonetheless, while the peak of his success was brief, it was considerable. In a 1999 interview with the Guardian, Roussos recalled a moment in the mid-70s when he had five albums in the UK top 10 at the same time.\n\nRoussos started in the late 60s in Aphrodite\u2019s Child, a pioneering Greek trio seen as one of the originators of progressive rock. Also in the group was Vangelis, who later composed the film scores for Chariots of Fire and Blade Runner. The band\u2019s final release, 666 \u2013 a double album based on the Book of Revelation \u2013 is viewed as one of rock\u2019s first concept albums.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demis Roussos in one of his famous kaftans. Photograph: George Wilkes Archive/Getty Images\n\nRoussos was born Artemios Ventouris Roussos in Alexandria, Egypt, to Greek-origin parents who had also been born in Egypt. Roussos studied music and sang in the city\u2019s Greek church until, as a teenager, his parents were forced to move to Greece, penniless, following the Suez crisis.\n\nIn Athens, Roussos played guitar and sang with the group, the Idols, later meeting Vangelis, who had a major influence on his career.\n\nAs part of Aphrodite\u2019s Child, Roussos had planned to base himself in London but work permit problems meant the group ended up in Paris, and it was France where they became most successful.\n\nWhen the group split following the recording of 666, Roussos began a solo career, having immediate success in 1971 with the single We Shall Dance.\n\nDuring much of his peak era Roussos cut a sometimes improbable figure in popular music with his significant girth, which reportedly peaked near 150kg. He later lost much of this and co-authored a diet book, A Question of Weight.\n\nIn 1985 the singer was on a TWA flight from Cairo to the US that was hijacked by armed men seeking the release of Arab prisoners from Israeli jails. Roussos was among eight Greek nationals freed after their government released a Hizbullah member.\n\nIn the 1999 Guardian interview Roussos dismissed as \u201cbollocks\u201d reports that he sang for the hijackers. He did, however, concede surprise at his former status as a sex symbol: \u201cYes. Because I never consider myself a sex god. I love women, I always liked women \u2013 no secret about that. It did surprise me, but when someone is at the top of the limelight of success, it is normal.\u201d\n\nRoussos also expressed pride at his immortalisation in Abigail\u2019s Party: \u201cIt was fun, this woman mentioning my name. But you see, that means I left my mark into the century. Nobody can deny that my name left a mark into the century\u2019s music.\n\n\u201cEven if I die tomorrow, Demis Roussos left a card, a trademark, something that cannot be forgotten.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/26/demis-roussos-dies-aged-69-greek-singer-forever-and-ever", "published": 1422230400.0, "image": "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/26/1422276072925/Demis-Roussos--010.jpg"}, {"title": "Greek singer Demis Roussos dies aged 68", "body": "Greek singer Demis Roussos, who sold more than 60 million albums worldwide, has died aged 68, the Hygeia Hospital in Athens has confirmed to the BBC.\n\nHe was best known for his solo hits in the 1970s and 80s, including Forever and Ever, Goodbye and Quand je t'aime.\n\nHe was also a member of progressive rock group Aphrodite's Child.\n\nRoussos was renowned for his off-screen role in Mike Leigh's 1977 TV play Abigail's Party, having provided the party's soundtrack.\n\nHe had been in the private hospital with an undisclosed illness for some time, and died surrounded by his family\n\nHis Aphrodite's Child bandmate Vangelis paid tribute in a statement that begins: \"Demis my friend.\n\n\"I have just arrived in London and I've been told that you decide to take the long voyage, I'm shocked because I can't believe that this happened so soon.\n\n\"Nature gave you this magic voice of yours which made millions of people around the world very happy.\"\n\nRoussos was as famous for his outfits as his music\n\nHe added: \"As for me, I keep those special memories that we share together those early days and I wish you to be happy wherever you are.\"\n\nHe signed off with the words: \"Goodbye my friend goodbye. Love Vangelis.\"\n\nGreek singer Nana Mouskouri paid tribute on French radio RTL: \"He had a superb voice, he travelled in the world ... he loved what he was doing.\n\n\"He was an artist, a friend. I hope he is in a better world.\"\n\nFinding fame\n\nThe singer was born Artemios Ventouris Roussos in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1946, to a Greek father and Egyptian mother of Italian origin.\n\nHe was raised there until his parents moved to Greece in the early 60s after losing their possessions during the Suez Crisis.\n\nRoussos began his music career at 17, when he joined the a band called The Idols, where he met Vangelis.\n\nAphrodite's Child produced three albums including It's Five O'Clock and 666, and enjoyed huge success in Europe in the late 1960s, especially France.\n\nRoussos went on to enjoy a successful solo career, topping the charts in several countries with Forever And Ever in 1973, before doing the same in the UK in 1976.\n\nMemorably he was referred to in Mike Leigh's Abigail's Party, by the character played by Alison Steadman, who plays his record in an attempt to impress her guests - commenting that he \"doesn't sound\" fat.\n\nDemis Roussos was still performing on stage in 2012\n\nIn Mike Leigh's 1977 TV play Abigail's Party, the character Beverly - played by Alison Steadman (back right), was a huge Demis Roussos fan\n\nRoussos was photographed surrounded by awards for the UK sales of his albums, including gold discs for Happy To Be and My Only Fascination\n\nOther solo hits include My Friend the Wind, My Reason, Someday Somewhere and Happy To Be On An Island In The Sun.\n\nRoussos' fondness for kaftans saw him dubbed \"the Kaftan King\" and he often wore them for his performances on shows such as Top of the Pops.\n\nHe was also famous for his vocal adaptation of the score from the 1981 film Chariots of Fire, which had been composed by Vangelis.\n\nIn 1978, he decided to keep a lower profile and moved to Malibu Beach in the US - where he shed much of the weight that had seen him routinely mocked by comedians like Freddie Starr.\n\nFamously, he was caught up in a plane hijacking when flight TWA 847 from Athens to Rome was hijacked by members of Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad in 1985.\n\nHe and his third wife were held at gunpoint for five days before they were released. Some of his fellow passengers endured 17 days in captivity.\n\nThe experience changed his life and afterwards he decided the best way he could help others and promote understanding in the world was by returning to music.\n\nHe released his album The Story of Demis Roussos not long after.\n\nThe star is survived by his mother, Olga (94), children Emily and Cyril, long-term partner Dominique, brother Costas and ex-wives Pamela and Monique.\n\nA funeral will be held on Friday, 30 January in Athens, his manager Denis Vaughan told the BBC.\n\n\"We will miss the amazing Demis, whose singing brought sunshine to the world,\" Vaughan added.\n\n\"He was a legend.

There was heavy gunfire in various Tripoli districts including Fashloum, Ashour, Jumhouria and Souq Al, sources told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"The security forces fired indiscriminately on the demonstrators,\" said a resident of one of the capital's eastern suburbs.\n\n\"There were deaths in the streets of Sug al-Jomaa,\" the resident said.\n\nThe death toll since the violence began remains unclear, though on Thursday Francois Zimeray, France's top human rights official, said it could be as high as 2,000 people killed.\n\nFollow more of Al Jazeera's special coverage here\n\nBut Saif al-Islam, Muammar Gaddafi's son, has called on the European Union to send a fact-finding team to Libya.\n\n\n\n\"We are not afraid of the facts.

There were an unknown number of casualties, Moshiri reported, based on information from witnesses who had reached on the Libyan-Tunisian border.\n\nForeign mercenaries\n\nThere have been frequent reports of foreign mercenaries working for Gaddafi against the protesters, but their nationality remains uncertain.\n\nThe government of Chad has moved to counter allegations that Chadian mercenaries were being recruited to go to Libya.\n\n\"International media inundates the public opinion with information alleging some Chadian would be mercenaries currently acting in Libya,\" Moussa Mahamat Dago, the Chad foreign ministry\u2019s general secretary, said on Friday.\n\n\"We want to formally and categorically deny all those allegations that are dangerous and could pose a material and physical danger to the many Chadians living in Libya for years and always in a peaceful way.\"\n\nPeople in eastern parts of the country, a region believed to be largely free from Gaddafi's control, held protests in support for the demonstrations in the capital.\n\n\"Friday prayer in Benghazi have seen thousands and thousands on the streets. All the banners are for the benefit of the capital, [they are saying] 'We're with you, Tripoli',\" Al Jazeera\u2019s Laurence Lee reported.\n\nIn the town of Derna, protesters held banners with the messages such as \"We are one Tribe called Libya, our only capital is Tripoli, we want freedom of speech\".\n\nAl Jazeera's correspondent in Libya reported on Friday that army commanders in the east who had renounced Gaddafi's leadership had told her that military commanders in the country's west were beginning to turn against him.\n\nThey warned, however, that the Khamis Brigade, an army special forces brigade that is loyal to the Gaddafi family and is equipped with sophisticated weaponry, is currently still fighting anti-government forces.\n\nThe correspondent, who cannot be named for security reasons, said that despite the gains, people are anxious about what Gaddafi might do next, and the fact that his loyalists were still at large.\n\n\"People do say that they have broken the fear factor, that they have made huge territorial gains,\u201d she said. \"[Yet] there's no real celebration or euphoria that the job has been done.\"\n\nOn Friday morning, our correspondents reported quoting witnesses that the town of Zuwarah had been abandoned by security forces and completely in the hands of anti-Gaddafi protesters.\n\nCheckpoints in the country's west on roads leading to the Tunisian border, however, were still being controlled by Gaddafi loyalists.\n\nIn the east, similar checkpoints were manned by anti-Gaddafi forces, who had set up a \"humanitarian aid corridor\" as well as a communications corridor to the Egyptian border, our correspondent reported.\n\nThousands massed in Az Zawiyah's Martyr's Square after the attack, calling on Gaddafi to leave office, and on Friday morning, explosions were heard in the city.\n\nArms caches blown up\n\nWitnesses say pro-Gaddafi forces were blowing up arms caches, in order to prevent anti-government forces from acquiring those weapons.\n\nClashes were also reported in the city of Misurata, located 200km east of Tripoli, where witnesses said a pro-Gaddafi army brigade attacked the city's airport with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades.\n\nThey told Al Jazeera that pro-democracy protesters had managed to fight off that attack. \"Revolutionaries have driven out the security forces,\" they said, adding that \"heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft guns\" had been used against them.\n\nMohamed Senussi, a resident of Misurata, said calm had returned to the city after the \"fierce battle\" near the airport.\n\n\"The people's spirits here are high, they are celebrating and chanting 'God is Greatest',\" he told the Reuters news agency by telephone.\n\nAnother witness warned, however, that protesters in Misurata felt \"isolated\" as they were surrounded by nearby towns still in Gaddafi's control.\n\nProtesters and air force personnel who have renounced Gaddafi's leadership also overwhelmed a nearby military base where Gaddafi loyalists were taking refuge, according to a medical official at the base.\n\nThey disabled air force fighter jets at the base so that they could not be used against protesters.\n\nOil terminal\n\nSoldiers helped anti-Gaddafi protesters take the oil terminal in the town of Berga, according to Reuters.\n\nThe oil refinery in Ras Lanuf has also halted its operations and most staff has left, according to a source in the company.\n\nSupport for Gaddafi within the country's elite continues to decline. On Friday, Abdel Rahman Al Abar, Libya's Chief Prosecutor, became one of the latest top officials to resign in protest over the bloodshed.\n\n\"What happened and is happening are massacres and bloodshed never witnessed by the Libyan people. The logic of power and violence is being imposed instead of seeking democratic, free, and mutual dialogue,\" he said.\n\nHis comments came as UN's highest human-rights body held a special session on Friday to discuss what it's chief had earlier described as possible \"crimes against humanity\" by the Gaddafi government.\n\nNavi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, urged world leaders to \"step in vigorously\" to end the violent crackdown.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was to hold a meeting on the situation in Libya later in the day, with sanctions the possible imposition of a no-fly zone over the country under Chapter VII of the UN charter on the table.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera and agencies", "url": "http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/02/2011225165641323716.html", "published": 1298592000.0, "image": "http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2011/2/25/2011225171731378472_20.jpg"}]}, {"title": "Tunisia approves new constitution", "articles": [{"title": "Tunisia approves groundbreaking new constitution", "body": "Can Libyans agree on a plan to give peace a chance?

The two men sparred furiously over Islam last week.\n\n\"With this, Tunisia should be a model for the region,\" Ennahda chief Rached Ghannouchi said of the charter. \"These advances in democracy in Tunisia should have a positive effect on the other Arab Spring countries.\"\n\nSuch compromise, though, looks difficult elsewhere.\n\nTwo years after Muammar Gaddafi was toppled, Libya's congress is deadlocked between Islamists and a nationalist party over the route for transition, a constitution is still undrafted, and former militia fighters run amok.\n\nEgypt's own elected Islamist president, Mohamed Mursi, has been deposed by the army and jailed and his Muslim Brotherhood declared a terrorist organization.\n\nEgyptians this month approved their new constitution as part of a transition plan from army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi after he ousted Mursi in July.\n\nCOMPROMISE\n\nTunisia's Islamists were more willing to compromise. After months of protests and deadlock, Ennahda agreed late last year to step aside for a caretaker administration of nonpolitical appointments that would govern until elections.\n\nMehdi Jomaa, an engineer and former minister appointed as premier in December, on Sunday named his cabinet with key posts given to technocrats with international experience.\n\nHakim Ben Hammouda, an economist with experience at the African Development Bank, was named finance minister and Mongi Hamdi, a former U.N. official, foreign minister.\n\n\"The objective is to arrive at elections and create the security and economic climate to get out of this crisis,\" Jomaa told reporters.\n\nNo date has been set for elections but they will be held later this year with Ennahda and key opposition alliance Nidaa Tounes likely to battle for the government.\n\nJomaa's new cabinet will have to tackle demands from international lenders to cut public spending and curb the budget deficit without triggering protests over social welfare.\n\nIslamist militants, tied to al Qaeda operations in North Africa, are also an increasing threat for a country that relies heavily on European tourism and overseas remittances for its hard currency income.\n\n(Writing by Patrick Markey; Editing by Andrew Heavens, Marguerita Choy and Steve Orlofsky)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/27/us-tunisia-politics-idUSBREA0P0P220140127", "published": 1390694400.0, "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140127&t=2&i=832909146&w=1200&fh=&fw=&ll=&pl=&r=CBREA0P1L7C00"}, {"title": "Tunisia prime minister names new cabinet", "body": "Mehdi Jomaa appoints foreign and finance ministers, completing a cabinet that will oversee new elections.\n\nMehdi Jomaa, Tunisia's prime minister, has named a new caretaker cabinet to govern the country until elections.\n\nSunday's development came quickly after an announcement by Jomaa that he had failed to reach a consensus on a new cabinet after objections from the opposition.\n\nIn the new government, Hakim Ben Hammouda, an economist with experience at the African Development Bank, will be the finance minister while Mongi Hamdi, a former UN official, will be the foreign minister.\n\nJomaa, a technocrat, was appointed in December after the ruling Islamist Ennahda party agreed to step down in a deal with secular opponents to end a political crisis.\n\nLive Box 201411484411752172\n\n\"The objective is to arrive at elections and create the security and economic climate to get out of this crisis,\" Jomaa said in Tunis.\n\nTunisia's assembly finished work on a new constitution last week, and will vote to approve it shortly.

He lit up our lives and those of the many friends he had all over the world. Our love and sympathy go out to Andrew and Stephen's family.

Boyzone (with Gately on far left) reunited in 2007 His spokeswoman said: \"He thanks you all for the messages of support at this sad time.\" Walsh earlier told the News of the World newspaper: \"We're all absolutely devastated. \"I'm in complete shock. I was only with him on Monday at an awards ceremony. We don't know much about what's happened yet. \"I only heard after The X Factor and we will rally around each other this week.

Singer Sir Elton John said: \"David and I are stunned by this tragedy. Stephen was the kindest, gentlest soul. HAVE YOUR SAY It's quite a shock. He had the best voice out of the band Caroline, Bedfordshire \"We send our love and condolences to his partner Andy and to all his friends everywhere.\" Fellow Irish boy band Westlife described Gately as a \"friendly, positive spirit and a passionate performer... \"Our thoughts are with Andy and the rest of his family, his friends, his legions of fans and of course his bandmates... who will be devastated at the loss of a truly beautiful person.\" Writing on the micro-blogging website Twitter, broadcaster Stephen Fry said: \"Just heard the very sad news about dear Stephen Gately. \"What a dreadful shock. He was loveable and sweet-natured and will be hugely missed.\" Music journalist Paul Gambaccini said: \"It's sad on a personal level and a professional level.\" Gately and Cowles tied the knot in 2006 Boyzone sold more singles than Take That in the 1990s, he said, and had 16 Top 5 singles. A year before Boyzone split, Gately revealed that he was gay and had a boyfriend. He later held a private civil partnership ceremony in London in 2006. After Boyzone, Gately continued his career as a solo artist, but was dropped by Polydor in 2001 after three top 20 singles. He enjoyed further success performing in musicals, including Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat in 2003-04. Gately also appeared in 2007 on ITV1's reality series Dancing on Ice, and was voted Hero of 1999 at the Smash Hits Poll Winners' Party.

Bryson Hull\n\nCOLOMBO, Jan 28 (Reuters) -- Hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans are trapped in a war zone that is now roughly 300 square km (115 sq miles) and the scene of heavy fighting between the Tamil Tiger rebels and a Sri Lankan army smelling victory.\n\nHere are questions and answers about their situation.\n\nHOW MANY ARE TRAPPED?\n\nThe United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross say that around 250,000 people, nearly all Tamils, are trapped in the fighting. The government says that figure is too high. The Tigers have not given a tally but on Tuesday, the pro-rebel web site www.TamilNet.com said 300,000 people now face hunger.\n\nHOW MANY HAVE BEEN KILLED OR WOUNDED?\n\nThe ICRC, the only aid agency with a permanent presence in the war zone, say hundreds have been killed and injured, but has not given an exact figure. The government tacitly acknowledged casualties on Wednesday, but says it has no official number and says figures reported so far are inflated. TamilNet says more than 300 have been killed and 1,000 wounded.\n\nWHY HAVEN'T THEY FLED?\n\nHuman Rights Watch and the Sri Lankan government say the Tigers have forced people to stay at gunpoint, and are using them to fight, build defences or act as a human shield. The Tigers, who for years have had a policy of making every family hand one person over to fight, deny that. They say the people are staying of their own free will and fear government persecution at army-guarded refugee camps. A few thousand people have navigated the jungles, filled with booby traps and mines, to reach army-controlled areas.\n\nWHAT IS BEING DONE ABOUT THEM?\n\nThe Sri Lankan army says it has set up a 32-square-km, no-fire zone in the middle of the battle area, and dropped leaflets urging people to go there. The LTTE says the military is firing into the safety zone indiscriminately. The Tigers have not answered the military's accusation that they moved their heavy weapons near populated areas and hospitals. Diplomats and aid agencies are applying heavy pressure on both sides. The United Nations and ICRC are working hard at getting convoys to bring aid in and people out, but have been frustrated in their efforts.\n\nWHY ARE AID AGENCIES HAVING TROUBLE?\n\nThe United Nations and ICRC require permission and guarantees of safe passage from both sides. The government last year ordered most aid agencies out of the war zone but has facilitated aid convoys with U.N. and ICRC help. The United Nations on Wednesday said the military stopped firing to allow a medical convoy to leave, but the Tigers then refused to let it go. [ID:nCOL285917].

The combatants are increasingly trading blame over deaths and injuries the ICRC on Tuesday said number in the hundreds. [ID:nLR669251]\n\nThe United Nations said it would try again to move hundreds of seriously wounded out of the war zone and into a government hospital, after its attempt on Tuesday was blocked when the Tigers denied travel permission and the military resumed firing.\n\n\"There was a brief window where there was no firing from the military, but then the LTTE said it was not safe to proceed,\" United Nations spokesman Gordon Weiss had said earlier.\n\nThe convoy was due to leave on Thursday at noon (0630 GMT).\n\nICRC spokeswoman Sarasi Wijeratne said that the convoy had not been given full security assurances, but declined to say more. ICRC is the only aid group with a full-time presence in the war zone and is the neutral liaison between both sides.\n\nINDIA PLEDGES AID\n\nSri Lanka's military on Wednesday accused the LTTE of blocking the convoy, and said casualties were lower than had been reported because some wounded were rebels.\n\n\"How can international organisations identify those injured as civilians? Anybody who throws away their weapons becomes a civilian,\" defence spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella told reporters. He said the military had no official casualty figures yet.\n\nThe pro-rebel web site www.TamilNet.com on Monday accused the military of killing as many as 300 people and wounding hundreds more with shelling in a no-fire zone the army set up a week ago.\n\nThe military has denied the accusation, and says the Tigers moved artillery there and had fired inside the safety zone.\n\nHuman rights watchdogs and the government accuse the LTTE -- designated a terrorist group by India, the United States and the European Union -- of keeping civilians in its territory to use them as fighters, battlefield labourers or human shields.\n\nThe Tigers could not be reached for comment because communications in the war zone are severed, but have denied similar allegations in the past.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee left Sri Lanka after meeting with Rajapaksa.\n\n\"The Sri Lankan government has reassured that they would respect the safe zones and minimise the effects of conflict on Tamil civilians,\" Mukherjee said in a statement.\n\nHe also said the military victories offered a chance to resume normalcy in northern Sri Lanka after 25 years of war. \"We will be working together on a reconstruction plan for these areas which will involve infrastructure and other support.\"\n\nThere was also progress on state-run Indian power generating company (NTPC.BO)'s plans to build a 500 megawatt power plant in the eastern port of Trincomalee, he said, without giving details.\n\nIndia in the late 1980s used the fate of Tamil civilians to launch a disastrous peacekeeping mission. Indian Tamil leaders in the ruling coalition, facing an election by May, have repeatedly pressed New Dehli to broker a truce as the LTTE has lost ground.

Humanitarian groups have said a major crisis is looming for 250,000 civilians with reports of hundreds killed. 'No sympathy' The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says India has a sizeable Tamil population and the Congress party-led government is under pressure to take a stronger line against Colombo's military offensive. Speaking to the media in Delhi on Wednesday, Mr Mukherjee said that India would send relief materials to the north. See map of the region He said he had asked for the UN and Red Cross to be given access to assess the situation on the ground. Mr Mukherjee said that while India had no sympathy for the Tamil Tigers, the Sri Lankan government's military victories offered it a political opportunity to bring peace to the Tamil-dominated northern areas. Mr Mukherjee met President Rajapaksa during his visit to Colombo on Tuesday.

Sri Lanka's minority Tamil community in the north-east has close cultural, religious and business ties with more than 50 million Tamils in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. There have been reports in the Indian media that a regional Tamil party, which heads the government of Tamil Nadu, has threatened to pull out of the Congress-led federal coalition if the security of Tamils in Sri Lanka is not ensured. Mr Mukherjee said the Indian government would \"work together with the government of Sri Lanka to enable all Sri Lankans, and particularly the Tamil community who have borne the brunt of the effects of the conflict, to lead normal lives as soon as possible\". President Rajapaksa said he had invited the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Muthuvel Karunanidhi, and state opposition leader Jayalalitha to come to Sri Lanka to \"see for themselves the situation on the ground and to persuade the [Tamil Tigers] to lay down arms and join the democratic mainstream.\" 'Meaningless' The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has warned the battle is causing a humanitarian crisis. It says hundreds of civilians have been killed and a quarter of a million people are trapped by the fighting. The ICRC based its figure of dead on body counts by its staff in local hospitals. It has called on the government troops and rebels to allow immediate and free access to the combat zone for humanitarian workers. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement Access for aid workers was so limited, it said, that the ICRC's own presence in the region was virtually meaningless. The ICRC wanted to evacuate scores of critically wounded people on Tuesday but said it did not receive security clearance. It said on Wednesday it had again asked for permission. The UN secretary general and the European Union have also expressed deep concern for civilians caught in the fighting. The British government repeated its call for a ceasefire. The military says it is involved in a final push against retreating rebels. Moving north from the captured rebel town of Mullaitivu, it is trying to secure the north-east coastline to encircle the rebels and says it hopes to control the entire north within weeks. The Tamil Tiger rebels could not be reached immediately for comment, but vowed on Monday to fight on. Access to the combat zone is tightly controlled, making it difficult to verify the actual situation. The military did take a group of journalists, including the BBC's Chris Morris, to the region on Tuesday. Our correspondent says that apart from soldiers on every corner in Mullaitivu, it is a ghost town. Most of the buildings, houses and shops are damaged or destroyed. He says its capture is a big victory for the army but that the Tigers also appear on the surface undaunted, with the sound of artillery fire not that far away echoing down the empty streets.

Iran state media said nine missiles had been fired in total, including a new Shahab-3, with a range of 2,000km (1,240 miles). Tehran has tested the missile before, but the latest launch comes amid rising tensions with the US and Israel over the country's nuclear programme. A senior US state department official said the launch was \"provocative\". Wednesday's early morning test at a remote desert site sent oil prices climbing. Israel should prepare itself to do what is needed to do\n\nZe'ev Boim\n\nIsraeli minister Brig Gen Hoseyn Salami, commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' air force, said: \"Our missiles are ready for shooting at any place and any time, quickly and with accuracy.\" Western leaders have been attempting to convince Tehran to stop enriching uranium, which it has continued doing despite sanctions from the UN and the European Union, insisting its nuclear programme is purely for civilian energy. US Under-secretary of State William Burns said that thanks to UN sanctions, Iran's real progress on its nuclear programme had been \"modest\", despite its sabre-rattling. \"We view force as an option that is on the table but a last resort,\" he told a Congressional hearing on Wednesday. The launches were intended to deter any Israeli or US strike against Tehran's nuclear installations, says BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus. Our correspondent - who is in Israel - says the country has a fully operational anti-ballistic missile system, which Israeli military experts believe can counter any Iranian threat.

Mike, London, UK In the Israeli parliament, Housing Minister Ze'ev Boim said: \"I suggest Israel will not talk, and Israel should prepare itself to do what is needed to do.\" The White House and both American presidential candidates also condemned the Iranian test. Describing Iran as a \"great threat\", the Democratic challenger, Barack Obama, called for tougher sanctions while his Republican rival, John McCain, said the test demonstrated the need for effective missile defence. The French, German and Italian governments expressed concern at the missile tests. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says Iran has no intention of attacking Israel On Monday, an adviser to Iran's supreme leader said it would retaliate against any military attack by hitting the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. Other commanders have threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which a large part of the world's oil flows, and to target the US and its allies around the world if Iran comes under attack. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has insisted his country had no intention of attacking Israel.

After more than five decades of an underdog, guerrilla struggle and two million lives lost, the Republic of South Sudan, Africa\u2019s 54th state, was about to declare its independence in front of a who\u2019s who of Africa, including the president of the country letting it go: Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan, a war-crimes suspect.\n\nMany of those who turned out to celebrate, overcome with emotion, spoke of their fathers, mothers, sons and daughters killed in the long struggle to break free from the Arab-dominated north.\n\n\u201cMy whole body feels happy,\u201d said George Garang, an English teacher who lost his father, grandfather and 11 brothers in the war.\n\nBy sunrise, the crowds were surging through the streets of Juba, the capital, to the government quarter, where the declaration of independence would be read aloud. Thousands of soldiers lined the freshly painted curbs, tiger patches on their arms, assault rifles in their hands. This new nation is being built on a guerrilla army \u2014 the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army, whose field commanders are now South Sudan\u2019s political leaders \u2014 and the amount of firepower here is unnerving.\n\nBy 9 a.m., the sun was dangerous.

Sudan had an unusually clear fault line, reinforced by British colonizers, with the southern third mostly animist and Christian and the northern part majority Muslim and long dominated by Arabs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe southern struggle blew up into a full-fledged rebellion in the 1960s and then again in the 1980s, and the Sudanese government responded brutally, bombing villages and unleashing Arab militias that massacred civilians and enslaved southern Sudanese children. Many of the same scorched-earth tactics associated with the crisis in Darfur, in Sudan\u2019s west, in the mid-2000s, were tried and tested long before that here in southern Sudan. (The International Criminal Court has indicted Mr. Bashir on genocide charges for the Darfur massacres.)\n\nThe central government also sowed divisions among the southerners, turning ethnic groups against one another. Some of the most unspeakable violence, like the Bor massacre in 1991 when toddlers were impaled on fence posts, was internecine.\n\nChristian groups had been championing the southern Sudanese since the 19th century. And their efforts paid off in 2000 when George W. Bush was elected president of the United States. He elevated Sudan to near the top of his foreign policy agenda, and in 2005, the American government pushed the southern rebels and the central government \u2014 both war weary and locked in a military stalemate \u2014 to sign a comprehensive peace agreement that guaranteed the southerners the right to secede.\n\nOn Saturday, one man held up a sign that said \u201cThank You George Bush.\u201d\n\nThe American-backed treaty set the stage for a referendum this January in which southerners voted by 98.8 percent for independence.\n\nAt 1:20 p.m. on Saturday, the southerners officially proclaimed their freedom.\n\n\u201cRecalling the long and heroic struggle of our people,\u201d began the legislative speaker, James Wani Igga.\n\nA few minutes later, the flag of Sudan was lowered and the new South Sudan flag (actually quite similar, plus a star) was raised.

But South Sudan \u2014 Texas-size and with about eight million people \u2014 is already plagued by ethnic tensions and rebellions. More than a half-dozen renegade groups are battling the government, some with thousands of fighters. And relations with the north are still dicey. Negotiators have yet to agree on a formula to split the revenue from the south\u2019s oilfields, which have kept the economies of both southern and northern Sudan afloat. And Mr. Bashir\u2019s army has been pounding southern-allied rebels who have refusing to disarm just north of the border in the Nuba Mountains, which some analysts worry could drag the whole region back into a full-scale war.\n\nThis is why Mr. Bashir\u2019s presence here was such a curiosity.

Barrie Walkley, the U.S. consul general in Juba, South Sudan's capital. The United States, which helped broker the peace deal, gives South Sudan $300 million a year in development funds and $150 million in food aid, and is financing the building of the country's first paved highway, which will run from the capital to the border with Uganda at a cost of $225 million.\n\nHow responsibly the Juba government will spend donor money \"is obviously a big concern,\" Walkley said. \"If you talk to the man on the street here, there is the perception that there is corruption at the highest levels.\"\n\nAlthough the government has an anticorruption commission, he said, it lacks prosecutorial powers.\n\nU.S. investment here has been discouraged by sanctions against Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, but with independence, South Sudan breaks free of them. USAID will hold a conference this year to give potential American investors a sense of the business landscape.\n\n\"There are opportunities here,\" and the agricultural potential is enormous, Walkley said. \"It should be the breadbasket of this part of Africa.\"\n\nNhial Bol, owner and editor of the Citizen, a 5,000-circulation daily newspaper with the motto \"Fighting Corruption and Dictatorship Everyday,\" believes the leadership of South Sudan wasn't prepared for independence when voters overwhelmingly approved it in January.

Rather, impeachment is a remedial proceeding to protect the public from an officer who has abused his position of trust.\"\n\nThe committee pointed out that the criminal complaint against Blagojevich alleges that he was secretly taped saying he would not appoint anyone to Obama's seat without some form of compensation. iReport.com: Do you trust your political leaders?\n\n\"The governor repeatedly demonstrated that his decision to appoint a senator would not be based on merits of the candidate or on public policy but rather on how that appointment could benefit him personally,\" the report said.\n\n\"The governor directed various individuals to conduct inquiries on his behalf to negotiate deals for the Senate appointment, affirmatively setting into action a plot to trade the Senate appointment for something of value to the governor,\" it said.\n\nAll About Rod Blagojevich \u2022 Illinois", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/09/blagojevich.impeachment/", "published": 1231459200.0, "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2009/POLITICS/01/09/blagojevich.impeachment/art.blagojevich.press.gi.jpg"}, {"title": "Illinois House Impeaches Governor", "body": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. \u2014 Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois was impeached by state lawmakers on Friday, setting the stage for a trial in the Senate, where the governor vowed he would prove his righteousness.\n\n\u201cI am confident that at the end of the day I will be properly exonerated,\u201d Mr. Blagojevich, 52, said at a Chicago news conference in which he cast himself as something of a martyred populist.\n\nThe State House of Representatives deliberated less than an hour and a half before voting 114 to 1 to impeach Mr. Blagojevich, making him the first Illinois chief executive to face such a trial. On Thursday, a 21-member bipartisan House committee unanimously recommended the same, citing an abuse of power in the ordinary work of government.\n\nIn the Senate, where the trial is expected to begin Jan. 26, lawmakers will face the difficult task of separating the political theatrics of the governor\u2019s problems from the legal accusations against him, which have yet to be proved in court or even brought in a formal indictment.\n\nIt is unclear whether the case against Mr. Blagojevich, a two-term Democrat, will be grounds enough for senators to convict him. The State Constitution does not define a standard for an impeachable offense. For a governor to be removed from office, two-thirds of the Senate \u2014 40 of the 59 members \u2014 must vote to convict him.\n\n\u201cThis is an extraordinary step to take when you\u2019re doing something like impeachment, which is in effect reversing the will of the voters in the last election,\u201d said Senator Kwame Raoul, a Chicago Democrat. \u201cYou want to set the bar high.\u201d\n\nStill, no one \u2014 not even Representative Milton Patterson, a Democrat who voted against impeachment, saying he needed more information \u2014 defended Mr. Blagojevich on the House floor. The governor was roundly denounced on various fronts, including for his arrest last month on federal corruption charges involving, among other things, scheming to sell the United States Senate seat vacated by President-elect Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cThis governor has breached the public trust,\u201d said Representative Barbara Flynn Currie, a Democrat, who was chairwoman of the impeachment committee.\n\nSeveral hours after the vote, Mr. Blagojevich, a two-term Democrat, called the news conference at his downtown Chicago office. He denounced the state legislature, quoted inspirational poetry and recited a litany of accomplishments.\n\nHe said that the impeachment was a \u201cforegone conclusion,\u201d and suggested that lawmakers were less concerned with the criminal allegations against him than with his policies \u2014 all driven, he said, by the Golden Rule \u2014 of helping children get health care, providing cheaper medicines from Canada to those in need, pressing for property tax relief and allowing women to get mammograms.\n\nTo promote those accomplishments, he brought to stand beside him a dozen Illinois residents who he said had benefited from his policies. They included a man in a wheelchair wearing a neck brace and two young children who played on the floor throughout his remarks.\n\n\u201cIs that an impeachable offense?\u201d he asked repeatedly, after describing ways he had helped individuals.\n\nLt. Gov. Pat Quinn later said Mr. Blagojevich had sidestepped the real point.\n\n\u201cThe governor did not address the central issue, which is the abuse of power,\u201d Mr. Quinn said. \u201cThat is really the essence of the charges against him and he\u2019ll have to address them in the Illinois Senate.\u201d\n\nBefore the impeachment vote, legislators \u2014 who had been called back to Springfield for a special session \u2014 had spent the morning discussing the merits of their case against Mr. Blagojevich.

Bachelet, who has also been a doctor and serves as defense minister for the outgoing government of President Ricardo Lagos, defeated billionaire businessman Sebastian Pinera in a runoff Sunday. With more than 99 percent of precincts reporting, she had 53.5 percent of the vote to Pinera's 46.5 percent. \"I want our government to be remembered as the government by everyone and for everyone,\" she said. Airline and broadcasting tycoon Pinera conceded defeat as results showed Bachelet with a solid lead and he thanked Bachelet for \"her triumph today.\" But the man who studied economics at Harvard vowed the fight would go on. \"We will continue to be a firm and constructive opposition.\" Bachelet spent five years in exile following the 1973 coup that bought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to power. Her father, an air force general, was tortured and killed after the U.S.-backed coup, and Bachelet herself was tortured before being sent into exile in Australia. \"What I want, and have and will always work for, is to build a society in which what happened to me and so many Chileans can never be repeated,\" she said in a December campaign appearance. Bachelet completed her training as a pediatrician in East Germany and served as health minister in Chile's center-left government before becoming defense minister. The new president is an agnostic single mother in a male-dominated, overwhelmingly Catholic society where divorce was legalized less than a year ago. \"To have a woman president shows that we are a freer, more just, more diverse, more prosperous and more modern Chile,\" Lagos said. In Washington, the White House congratulated Bachelet and praised Chilean voters \"for their strong commitment to democracy.\" \"We have an excellent, long-standing relationship with Chile and look forward to working with the new president and her team,\" White House spokesman David Almacy said. Bachelet's victory adds to a leftward shift in Latin American politics. Leftists hold presidential power in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela. Bolivian President-elect Evo Morales -- a former coca farmer and union leader who promises to nationalize the country's natural gas industry -- is slated to take office January 22.

Opposition candidate Sebastian Pinera conceded after winning 46.5 percent in today's run-off.\n\nThe next president will take power with the highest credit rating in Latin America, a seventh year of economic expansion under way and a record budget surplus because of a surge in prices for copper, Chile's top export. Bachelet, a Socialist party member and the second woman elected president in South America, said she will use that revenue to help almost 3 million poor in a country where workers earn an average of $522 a month.\n\nChileans ``must know that the society in which they live protects them,'' Bachelet told thousands of supporters. ``My commitment is that in 2010, we will have consolidated a system of social protection.'' She said that she will improve access to education and health care and provide for the elderly.\n\nChileans, who honked car horns in capital after the vote was announced, gave the coalition its fourth consecutive victory in presidential elections. Thousands of Bachelet supporters filled the streets, waving banners and cheering in the capital.\n\nThe victory was 1 percentage point wider than a Jan. 5 forecast by pollster Mori Chile SA.\n\nRoad to Presidency\n\nIn the first-round election last month, Bachelet won 46 percent of the vote, short of a majority needed for a victory. Pinera, a former senator whose family owns a $681 million stake in Lan Airlines SA, Chile's largest carrier, garnered second place with 26 percent of the vote.\n\nToday, Chilean President Ricardo Lagos, 67, who can't run in this election, was applauded by voters after casting his ballot.\n\n``Her's is a historic triumph,'' Lagos said in the capital of Santiago. ``We are a new Chile, having a woman president shows that.''\n\nUnder his leadership, the country signed trade accords with the U.S., Europe and China. The $103 billion economy expanded at least 6 percent for a second year in 2005, according to government estimates.\n\nLagos will end his six-year term in March with a 75 percent approval rating, according to the Mori Chile poll.\n\n``The coalition has shown they can govern,'' said Alicia Bonifaz, a 23-year-old law student who voted for Bachelet today.\n\nThe coalition won a majority in both the nation's Lower House and Senate in elections last month.\n\nDictatorship\n\nBachelet will take office more than three decades after, as a 23-year-old medical student, she was arrested and tortured during Pinochet's dictatorship. Her father, a general, died in jail less than a year earlier after being tortured on suspicion he opposed the 1973 military coup.\n\n``She's a strong woman,'' said Maria Eugenia Jana, a retired art teacher who voted for Bachelet. ``She's had a full life, one with sacrifice. She has suffered.''\n\nBachelet said her experiences influenced her to study defense policy. In 2002, she became defense minister, the first woman to hold that post in Chile. During her campaign, Bachelet pledged to pick women for half of her Cabinet posts.\n\nAs defense minister, Bachelet told military commanders assembled before their new chief that she was a woman, a socialist, separated, and agnostic, ``all the sins together,'' Bachelet joked at a news conference in November.\n\n`Scrutiny'\n\nBachelet, a trained pediatrician, is separated from her husband and raised three children in a mainly Catholic country where divorce was legalized for the first time in 2004 and where men and women vote in different buildings.\n\nThe candidate, who has short brown hair and wears glasses, has won support from women who identify with her background, said Patricio Valdivieso, a professor at the Pontific Catholic University of Chile.\n\n``She's a regular woman,'' said Carolina Cruz, a computer programmer, adding, ``she'll have to fight down sexists.''\n\nJuan Lindau, a professor at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, said that Bachelet's career suggests that she ``has become extraordinarily adept at handling sexism, given her long career in the still largely male political world of Chile.''\n\nShe will ``face greater scrutiny because of her gender and will consequently need a strong first year in office,'' Lindau said.\n\nRecord Surplus\n\nBachelet becomes the second elected female president in South America after Janet Jagan, who was elected in Guyana after the death of her husband, President Cheddi Jagan.\n\nOther women who have reached the presidency in South America, without being elected to the post, include former congresswoman Lidia Gueiler in Bolivia; former Argentine Vice President Maria Estela Martinez de Peron; and in Ecuador former Vice President Rosalia Arteaga.\n\nBachelet has pledged to increase pension benefits for the elderly, provide nationwide access to pre-school and ensure poor working mothers have childcare.\n\nIn her first year in office, she said she will send a bill to congress to ensure that more workers are covered at a lower cost under a private pension system put in place during the dictatorship. She also will seek to end Pinochet-era election rules blocking smaller parties from gaining congressional seats.\n\nMarkets\n\nBachelet will keep in place rules requiring the government to save part of its windfall when prices for copper surge, said Francisco Lepeley, who manages $1.77 billion in fixed-income securities at MetLife Chile Seguros de Vida SA.\n\nThe election won't affect the country's currency or stock markets tomorrow, Lepeley said in a telephone interview from Santiago.\n\n``The market had already incorporated this,'' Lepeley said after the election's results were announced.\n\nLike prior coalition governments, Bachelet will seek to increase the country's trade, Lepeley said.\n\nSome voters said that Pinera, part of the opposition National Renovation party, as a businessman was better suited to run the country. He declined at a news conference last year to disclose the value of all his holdings.\n\n``Chile is a country with several free trade agreements so we need a leader who understands business,'' David Rodriguez, 63, said, standing in the shade today after voting in the port city of Vina del Mar.\n\nExports\n\nThe next president of Chile, the world's biggest copper producer, will take over as a 54 percent increase in copper prices in 12 months bolsters the nation's $103 billion economy.\n\nThe government had a budget surplus last year equal to 4.5 percent of gross domestic product -- the largest among Latin America's major economies, according to Goldman, Sachs & Co.\n\n``She won't have to complain about resources,'' said Juan Chavarria, who manages $170 million at Bandesarrollo Administradora General de Fondos in Santiago.\n\nBachelet's challenge will be improving education and workers' skills to ensure the nation competes globally, Chavarria said. Almost 19 percent of Chileans live in poverty.\n\n``We are climbing a ladder while others take the elevator,'' Chavarria said. ``We make progress, but others make it faster.''\n\nA 10 percent gain by the Chilean peso against the dollar in six months also is making the nation's exports of salmon, fruit and wine more expensive for consumers in the U.S., the country's biggest market. And while Chile has increased exports with trade agreements, it's still dependent on copper, Chavarria said.\n\nChile has a long-term foreign currency rating of A from Standard & Poor's and a Baa1 rating from Moody's Investors Service.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Heather Walsh in Santiago at hlwalsh@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Laura Zelenko in New York at lzelenko@bloomberg.net", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&sid=aS7Hg8JyFQ2A&refer=top_world_news", "published": 1137283200.0, "image": ""}]}, {"title": "Egyptian military appoints committee to amend constitution", "articles": [{"title": "Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood seeks political party status", "body": "Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood will apply to become a political party, it announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Brotherhood \"envisions the establishment of a democratic, civil state that draws on universal measures of freedom and justice, with central Islamic values serving all Egyptians regardless of colour, creed, political trend or religion,\" it said in the statement.\n\nAlthough officially illegal, the Muslim Brotherhood is regarded as one of the most organized groups in Egypt.\n\nIt has said it does not plan to run a candidate for president when elections are held to replace Hosni Mubarak, who resigned on Friday.\n\nAlthough officially illegal, the Muslim Brotherhood is regarded as one of the most organized groups in Egypt.

Living with it won't be easy, but it should not be seen as inevitably our enemy,\" said Riedel.\n\nThe Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1928 to oppose British control of Egypt with Its goal the creation of an independent Islamic state. Although it allegedly engaged in assassination and other violence against the British and supported the coup that brought Gamal Abdel Nasser to power in 1952, the Brotherhood has been illegal since 1954, when it was convicted of attempting to assassinated Nasser, charges the group denied.\n\nNasser ruthlessly suppressed the group, and his successors, Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak, continued the repression. The Brotherhood subsequently renounced violence, is engaged in providing social services to the populace, opposes the peace treaty with Israel and supports democratic elections.\n\nOn its English language website, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood calls for establishing an Islamic state in accordance with the provision of Islamic Sharia law.\n\nEd Husain, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the Muslim Brotherhood \"ought to be a welcomed force within Egyptian politics\" if it accepts full rights for women and for religious minorities.\n\nBut his colleague at the council, Isobel Coleman, said the group hasn't done that, pointing to statements by the Brotherhood that neither a woman nor a non-Muslim could ever lead Egypt.\n\nBut Republican Congresswoman Sue Myrick of North Carolina worried that the government did not see the danger.\n\n\"I'm very concerned that they're using the peaceful protests in Egypt for a power grab and that we in the government doesn't seem -- we don't seem to grasp that threat in the way it concerns me,\" she said at a congressional hearing last week. \"The Brotherhood isn't a danger just because they're terrorists, but because they push an extremist ideology that causes others to commit acts of terrorism.\"'\n\nThe 83-year-old organization has never been placed on the U.S. State Department's list of terrorist organizations and officially renounced violence in the 1970s. The organization was a minor player in the demonstrations that toppled Mubarak.\n\nBut the U.S. chief intelligence officer raised a stir when he referred to the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood as a \"largely secular\" organization in response to a question from Myrick at the hearing.\n\n\"The term 'Muslim Brotherhood' is an umbrella term for a variety of movements, in the case of Egypt, a very heterogeneous group, largely secular, which has eschewed violence and has decried Al Qaeda as a perversion of Islam,\" said James Clapper, the director of national intelligence. \"They have pursued social ends, a betterment of the political order in Egypt.\"\n\nClapper's office later clarified the director's comments.\n\n\"In Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood makes efforts to work through a political system that has been, under Mubarak's rule, one that is largely secular in its orientation -- (Clapper) is well aware that the Muslim Brotherhood is not a secular organization.\"\n\nCNN's Pam Benson contributed to this report", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/02/15/egypt.muslim.brotherhood/index.html?iref=allsearch", "published": 1297814400.0, "image": "http://www.cnn.com/video/world/2011/02/16/muslim.brotherhood.whats.next.cnn.640x360.jpg"}, {"title": "Egypt crisis: Army sets constitution reform deadline", "body": "The military is trying to quell strikes and protests still being held around the country\n\nEgypt's ruling military council has announced that work on reforming the country's constitution is to be completed in 10 days.\n\nA committee led by a retired judge has been tasked with proposing legal changes, said the council.\n\nIt earlier suspended the current constitution, which was amended during ousted President Hosni Mubarak's tenure to strengthen his grip on power.\n\nMr Mubarak stepped down last week after more than two weeks of protests.\n\nThe higher military council - which assumed power after Mr Mubarak stepped down - said on Tuesday that the amended constitution would be put to a popular referendum.\n\nThe eight-member committee is mostly made up of experts in constitutional law but it includes a senior figure from the opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIt is headed by Tariq el-Bishri, considered one of Egypt's top legal minds, and on Tuesday held its opening meeting with Defence Minister Mohamed Hussein Tantawi.\n\nThe committee is instructed to \"amend all articles as it sees fit to guarantee democracy and the integrity of presidential and parliamentary elections\".\n\nStrikes ease\n\nThe BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says it looks as if the military council is fulfilling its pledge to hand the country back to civilian rule as quickly as possible.\n\nTahrir Square, the focus of protests in Cairo, has largely returned to normal\n\nThe speed of the move will reassure the opposition, he says, although there might be some nervousness about whether it is an attempt to push through changes in too much of a rush.\n\nThe military council has also repeated its calls for an end to strikes that spread across the country during Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe stoppages are dealing a further blow to Egypt's ailing economy, damaged by three weeks of unrest.\n\n\"The supreme council is aware of the economic and social circumstances society is undergoing, but these issues cannot be resolved before the strikes and sit-ins end,\" the state news agency Mena quoted the military as saying.\n\n\"The result of that will be disastrous,\" it added.\n\nStrikes eased on Tuesday, mainly because offices and businesses were closed for an Islamic holiday.\n\nBut correspondents said some smaller protests continued in provinces outside Cairo, mainly called by workers demanding higher pay.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Mubarak, 82, is reported to be in poor health in his residence in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.\n\nThe Saudi-owned daily newspaper Asharq al-Awsat said on Tuesday that the former president's health was \"declining drastically\" and he was refusing to travel abroad for treatment.

At least six policemen escorting the team bus were killed, along with a driver. Seven cricketers and an assistant coach were injured. Pakistani officials said about 12 gunmen were involved and grenades and rocket launchers have been recovered. Officials said the incident bore similarities to deadly attacks in Mumbai in India last November. The Mumbai attacks were blamed on Pakistan-based Islamic militants.

Evacuation Reports suggest 10 to 12 gunmen ambushed the team coach and its accompanying police detail on the Liberty Square roundabout in the heart of Lahore, as the convoy was on the way to the Gaddafi stadium for a Test match.\n\nThe BBC's Barbara Plett, in Islamabad, says accounts suggest the attack was sophisticated in nature, with one group of gunmen firing a rocket-propelled grenade in order to create a diversion, while others then approached, firing guns on the convoy. She says the gunmen - two of whom were shown in TV pictures carrying backpacks - seemed to be well-trained.

'Security failure' The Pakistani politician Imran Khan, a former captain of the country's cricket team, said the Sri Lankan visitors had been given inadequate protection. \"This was one of the worst security failures in Pakistan,\" he said. \"The Pakistan government guaranteed the Sri Lankan cricket team that they would provide them security.\" FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript.

Grenades and rocket launchers were found there, police said, and a manhunt is under way. Our correspondent says security forces will be investigating any connections to al-Qaeda and Taleban militants as well as Kashmiri jihadi groups. A Pakistani air force helicopter has now airlifted uninjured members of the Sri Lankan team out of the Gaddafi Stadium. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse condemned the \"cowardly terrorist attack\" and ordered the players' evacuation back to Sri Lanka. A plane is being chartered for this purpose. Mr Rajapakse is cutting short a visit to Nepal. Thilan Samaraweera (L) and Tharanga Paranavitana went to hospital Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari also strongly condemned the attack, and ordered an immediate investigation \"so that the perpetrators are identified and their motives exposed\", said a statement from his office. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for India's foreign ministry offered sympathy and urged Pakistan to take \"prompt, meaningful and decisive steps to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure once and for all\". But a Pakistani minister, Sardar Nabil Ahmed Gabol, reportedly told private Geo TV that evidence suggested the attackers came across the border from India. He said the assault came in reaction to the Mumbai attacks, and was a \"declaration of open war on Pakistan by India\". The third day of play in the Second Test was scheduled to begin, but officials said the match has now been cancelled. Security fears Pakistan is engaged in a bloody struggle against Islamist insurgents who have staged high-profile attacks on civilian targets before. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan authorities are waging their own domestic military campaign against Tamil Tiger separatist rebels. India and Australia have pulled out of cricket tours in Pakistan in the recent past citing security concerns. The sport's world governing body, the International Cricket Council, last month decided not to hold the 2009 Champions Trophy in Pakistan due to safety worries.\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

But cable news missed that bit.\n\nNancy Pelosi refusing to answer questions about Anthony Weiner at a press conference today. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty\n\nSo after three weeks, why did Weiner decide to go now? Obviously the intense pressure from Democrats, including Obama, Pelosi and the powerful chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Steve Israel, has taken its toll.\n\nWeiner himself said that his wife, Huma Abedin, had supported him. But possibly she changed her mind after returning from an overseas trip in her role as an aide to Hillary Clinton. And the news that she was pregnant may have played a part.\n\nTop plausible conspiracy theory of the day is the thought that New York City was due to lose a congressional seat due to population changes, and so that Weiner's seat was in danger of being redistricted into oblivion.\n\nOh dear \u2013 CNN just briefly mixed up a Weiner story with an on-screen headline about al-Qaida's new leader. Whoops.\n\nLocal newspaper the New York Times speaks to a \"top Democratic official\" for more details on the latest developments:\n\nThe top Democratic official said Mr Weiner called Representative Nancy Pelosi of California and Representative Steve Israel of New York last night while they were at the White House picnic to inform them he had decided to resign on Thursday. Mr. Weiner plans to resign in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, at 2pm, at the spot where he announced his first campaign for City Council in 1992, according to two people told of his plans. The news comes as Democratic leaders prepared to hold a meeting on Thursday to discuss whether to strip the 46-year-old congressman of his committee assignments, a blow that would severely damage his effectiveness. Ms Pelosi had called for an ethics investigation into Mr. Weiner's actions. Mr Weiner began telling his most trusted advisers about his decision on Wednesday night by phone, informing them that it no longer seemed fair to his constituents and his colleagues for him to remain in office. Mr Weiner, a Democrat, came to the conclusion that he could no longer serve after having long discussions with his wife, Huma Abedin, when she returned home on Tuesday after traveling abroad with her boss, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n\"I'd much rather be discussing economic issues ... than talking about this,\" says Wolf Blitzer on CNN, more in sorrow than in truth. I mean, anger.\n\nThe next CNN presenter immediately starts talking about \"half-nude Weiner pictures\" and playing clips of David Letterman makes Weiner gags.\n\nThe question is whether Weiner steps down immediately or is not seeking re-election \u2013 and thus sticking around until January 2013, the end of his current term.\n\nIf he does step down as of now, that means another special election in New York state, the third in two years caused by a sex scandal.\n\nThere was Democrat Eric Massa in 2010, Republican Chris Lee earlier this year (also over sexy pictures), and now Weiner. A little further back there was Eliot Spitzer. Something in the water?\n\nAnother reason for Weiner to go today may have been the prospect of further fallout from one of Weiner's sexting targets: a sometime porn star named Ginger Lee, who gave a press conference yesterday:\n\nLee, from La Vergne, Tennessee, said the pair exchanged about 100 emails between March and June, but said she never received photos from Weiner and never sent him any. She said she followed him on Twitter because she liked his stance on Planned Parenthood funding and health care, and that he repeatedly tried to turn the conversation into sexual banter. \"My package and I are not going to beg,\" Weiner emailed at one point, according to Allred. Another email said \"I have wardrobe demands too \u2013 I need to highlight my package.\" \"I did not reciprocate,\" Lee said Wednesday. Lee said as Weiner's Twitter scandal was unfolding, the married lawmaker gave her a statement to put out, which read: \"I haven't met Rep Weiner. I follow him on Twitter because I support him & what he stands for. I have been hounded by his political opponents, but that hasn't changed my view of him and what he fights for.\"\n\nLee said she was happy to talk to the congressional ethics investigation that was underway \u2013 and Weiner would have been in trouble because he asked Lee to cover up their epistolary relationship.\n\nGraphic\n\nNancy Pelosi tweets:\n\nThx followers for telling me cables cut me off - what I said: I'm here to talk about #jobs & this bill-> http://t.co/MOIijaO\n\nHere's the top line:\n\nDemocratic leaders in the US House of Representatives on Thursday said they would try to force a vote on a China currency bill that House members overwhelmingly approved last year but that died in the Senate.\n\nGraphic\n\nFrom the comments below, Huffmeister is sad at Anthony Weiner's demise and makes some interesting points that re worth discussing:\n\nThis is such a horrible thing to have happened in the US Congress at a time when Republicans are the dominant voice. He's been at the forefront of the health care debate and actually calls out the Republicans on how they're bought and paid for by the insurance industry. Just watch him on YouTube and you'll see what I mean. Now we Democrats only have one congressman who will actually speak out and tell the truth and that's Bernie Sanders. It's a sad day, yet another man ruined by his carnal desires. I can't believe he's having to resign over this when Bill Clinton was did have relations with another woman, in the Oval Office no less, was actually impeached by Congress, and even then he didn't have to leave!\n\nBernie Sanders isn't in fact a Democratic congressman, he's an independent but he caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate so that amounts to much the same thing.\n\nThe difference between Weiner and Clinton is that no one was in a position to force Clinton to retire other than through impeachment. Weiner was far more vulnerable to party pressure \u2013 and he had an election in 2012.\n\nHere's the YouTube clip referenced.\n\nWeiner's resignation \"marks the end of a nearly three-week sex scandal without the sex,\" as the Associated Press puts it:\n\nIt also signals an ignominious pause if not an end in a once-promising political career. Weiner ran for New York mayor in 2005, and had talked of seeking the office again. He at first denied having sent any inappropriate photos, then recanted in a remarkable news conference 10 days ago at which he admitted having exchanged inappropriate messages with several women. His confession triggered a tabloid-style frenzy in print and online that only grew more pronounced a few days later when an X-rated photo of the 46-year-old lawmaker surfaced on a website.\n\nHere's an interesting view on why Weiner's resignation is news, from a Republican political perspective:\n\nDoes it matter? Yes. The Democratic Party lost all momentum with its Medi-scare campaign due to a self-inflicted wound that festers at least as long as Weiner remains in office, and cannot heal until he disappears. By refusing at first to tell the truth, and then by refusing to resign, he dragged his party, his friends, and his wife through a frustrating, bizarre scandal that shouldn't have lasted even one week. Had he resigned the day of his fateful Breitbart hijacked news conference, the news cameras would have gone away by the end of the week. Instead, weeks later, the cameras were parked outside his home to film his wife's return home yesterday, and hovering over porn star Ginger Lee's silly 'news conference.'\n\n\n\nWhen Republicans were faced with Congressman Chris Lee's online and offline dalliances, they were quick to throw him under the bus so the party could move on. The party did, the media did, and Americans did, after pausing for a quick chuckle.\n\nGawkers gather outside Anthony Weiner's locked office on Capitol Hill, Washington DC. Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters\n\nAlways classy Washington DC: people having photos taken of themselves outside of Anthony Weiner's office in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill.\n\nPolitico watches the locked door:\n\nWalking past the crush of TV cameras and reporters in the Rayburn House office building, a woman stopped to ask, \"A press conference? Out here?\" Then she looked at the nameplate on the door to her right: \"Oh, it's Weiner.\" Since news broke this morning that Rep. Anthony Weiner plans to resign, there has been no sign of the congressman at his office. But there's plenty of other activity. A delivery man tried to bring a package to Weiner's door, but gave up after the T.V. cameras lurched toward him, hoping the locked doors would open. TV crews have been camped out here for the past several weeks since the Twitter scandal broke. Some passers-by snickered or used their smartphones to photograph themselves in front of Weiner's hallway name plate before it's removed. Democrats walking by had little to say about the matter, other than that it will help them get back to their message of jobs, the economy and protecting Medicare.\n\nAnthony Weiner has just been spotted going into his apartment building in Queens \u2013 and somehow is going to get to his press conference in Brooklyn scheduled for 2pm. Not gonna happen.\n\nOver on Cif America, Megan Carpentier says Weiner could yet make a comeback:\n\nThe one person he has, however, been most compared to is former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, whose fall from grace after his (thankfully not photographically chronicled and tweeted) prostitution scandal resulted in a spell in the purgatory of media oblivion, before a return to the spotlight with his own television show. Weiner could go that route, too, eventually \u2013 and, goodness knows, liberals all-but-universally loved him on camera (when he kept his clothes on).\n\nOnly moments to go before Weiner's scheduled announcement.\n\nAccording to MSNBC, Weiner will make a five-minute long statement and take no questions.\n\nStill no Weiner but Andrew Breitbart is doing a victory lap on Fox News. It was Breitbart who first broke the news of Weiner's first \"bulging underpants\" tweet, and that's why we're here now.\n\nFox commentators are discussing the possibility that Weiner resigns and runs in the special election (or by-election) and offers himself to the voters. It's a thought.\n\nWeiner has left his apartment and is en route to the venue of his announcement.\n\nMeanwhile, with impeccable timing, the Brookings Institution announces an exciting new conference:\n\nHow Social Networking Can Re-Invigorate American Democracy and Civic Participation\n\nNo, Weiner isn't a key-note speaker. Yet.\n\nLocal newspaper the New York Times is offering live streaming video coverage of Weiner's press conference here.\n\nNot long now.\n\nHere he is. No sign of his wife, Huma Adedin. A million flashbulbs go off.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" says Weiner. Well, that's not true, at least in his case.\n\nNow there's some bits about how awesome it was to be elected by the people of the 9th congressional district. Yes, yes, get a move on.\n\nSo far it sounds like he's running for office again.\n\n\"I am here today to apologise again,\" says Weiner. \"Unfortunately the distration that I have created makes that [work] impossible... so today I am announcing my resignation from congress.\"\n\nThere are loud cheers and some people shouting. \"Bye, bye pervert,\" someone calls out.\n\nThings quiet down and Weiner continues.\n\nMore shouting. \"Are you more than seven inches?\" is one comment. Oh dear. This is bad.\n\nNow Weiner is thanking his mother and father. What?\n\nThis isn't a resignation speech, this is a comeback speech. Very badly mistimed. My first reaction is: really?\n\nChuck Todd on MSNBC says: \"I'm kind of wondering why he did it.\"\n\nGood point \u2013 could he not have just put out a statement and achieved the same thing?\n\nIt turns out the heckler was a guy from the Howard Stern Show, the same guy that did the heckling at Weiner's press conference the week before last.\n\nHow the New York Times's City Room blog covered the statement:\n\nMr Weiner's speech, brief and to the point, lasted less than five minutes. Wearing a blue suit, he spoke quickly but carefully. When a heckler shouted \"Pervert!\" just as he spoke the words \"I'm announcing my resignation,\" he simply spoke louder. Mr Weiner began by recalling how 20 years ago he \"stood in this very room in the council center and asked my neighbors for their help in electing me to the City Council. He saluted his constituents and, indirectly, himself. \"I have never forgotten my neighbors because they represent the same middle-class story as mine,\" he said. He offered an apology \"for the citizens of my district but particularly for my wife, Huma\" and said he was leaving office \"most importantly, so that I can continue to heal from the damage that I have caused.\" Mr Weiner thanked his staff, his colleagues his family, and Ms Abedin, \"to whom I owe so much.\" Then he strode from the room, ignoring the questions shouted in his wake.\n\nAfter apologising to his wife, family, colleagues and constituents, who didn't Anthony Weiner apologise to in his statement?\n\n\n\nGood point.\n\nPolitico has a pretty good summary of Weiner's announcement and the background:\n\nSeveral sources with ties to the couple said the immediate problem for Weiner is a lack of income, especially with his first child on the way. He started working in politics right out of college, and has never worked as anything but a staffer or elected official, lacking private sector experience on his resume that will let him do much beyond being an elected official. Part of what Weiner has been focused on for the last several days, according to sources, was exploring possible places where he could land.\n\nFor politics geeks, here's far too much detail from Daily Kos Elections about what the Democratic party may or may not do regarding Weiner's congressional district, NY-09, in the looming special election.\n\nHere's how the New York Daily News covered Weiner's statement:\n\nAnthony Weiner finally stepped down Thursday after a three-week cybersex scandal that turned the once promising politician into a laughingstock. \"I had hoped to be able to continue the work that the citizens of my district elected me to do,\" Weiner said. \"But the distraction that I have created has made that impossible.\" Then Weiner said he was resigning his seat and in a sign of how low his stock had fallen in a district that reelected him handily several times, some in the crowd actually broke into cheers - and one man was heard yelling \"bye-bye pervert.\"\n\nAn exquisitely-timed headline, from The Hill:\n\nSuspicious package found at Weiner's office\n\nI'll say.\n\nSo that's the end of Weiner and his weiner. Here's the statement that Nancy Pelosi promised to make after Weiner's press conference:\n\nCongressman Weiner exercised poor judgment in his actions and poor judgment in his reaction to the revelations. Today, he made the right judgment in resigning. I pray for him and his family and wish them well.\n\nSo there we are. Let's end this live blog with this Twitter thought from the novelist and writer Ayelet Waldman, tweeting as @ayeletw:\n\nI really didn't think Weiner needed to resign. I mean, moron? yes. Jackass? yes. But, hello. It's CONGRESS. #somanypricksinoneplace\n\nThanks for reading.", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/richard-adams-blog/2011/jun/16/anthony-weiner-resignation-twitter-live", "published": 1308182400.0, "image": "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/6/16/1308252539786/weiner_statement_1.jpg"}, {"title": "Anthony Weiner plans to step down, New York press conference scheduled", "body": "NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 06: Rep.

(Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Andrew Burton/Getty Images\n\nUPDATED 11:06 a.m. ET\n\nAndrew Burton/Getty Images\n\nEmbattled Rep. Anthony Weiner is throwing in the towel.\n\nAfter nearly three weeks of pressure building on Weiner to call it quits, the New York Democrat has planned a news conference for 2:00 p.m ET Thursday afternoon in Brooklyn to announce his resignation.\n\nThe scandal had become a distraction for House Democrats, who had raised pressure on Weiner to resign in recent days after he admitted June 6 to exchanging lewd photos and messages with women he met online.\n\nWeiner late Wednesday told House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of his plan to step down Thursday, two Democratic aides told CBS News. Pelosi had called for his resignation Saturday and President Obama weighed in late Monday, saying if it were him, he would resign. House Speaker John Boehner called for his resignation Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats had three days in late May of talking about a special election in upstate New York that they hoped could serve as a launching pad for reclaiming control of the House of Representatives in next year's elections before Weiner's story broke and changed the topic.\n\nSeveral House Democrats had signaled the resignation was coming this week.\n\nRep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.) said Weiner was waiting his wife, Huma Abedin, to return from an overseas trip with her boss Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Abedin returned to Washington Wednesday.\n\nAnd Democratic leaders had planned a meeting for later Thursday where it was possible they could have begun steps to strip him of his committee assignments in Congress. The House Ethics Committee on Monday began a preliminary inquiry that could have bloomed into a full investigation had he decided to stay in office.\n\nThe scandal got even stranger Wednesday, when a stripper who exchanged emails and messages with Weiner said he asked her to lie about their interactions and called for him to step down.\n\nGinger Lee, a former porn actress who currently works as a \"feature dancer\" in nightclubs, said today that Weiner tried several times to engage her in sexual communication but that she never took the bait.\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment on news that Weiner would step down.\n\nCBS News Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes discusses today's developments below:\n\n", "url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20071556-503544.html", "published": 1308182400.0, "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/3988344b-a643-11e2-a3f0-029118418759/thumbnail/620x350/c3a5d1829afba2fcc28a28a649840e20/115289340.jpg"}, {"title": "Weiner's wife returns as pressure mounts for his resignation", "body": "Washington (CNN) -- The wife of Rep. Anthony Weiner returned home from a work trip Wednesday as her husband faced mounting pressure to resign over a \"sexting\" scandal that he lied about before admitting his involvement.\n\nWeiner's wife, Huma Abedin, is a top aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with whom she had been traveling in the Middle East and Africa since June 8. Abedin, who is pregnant with the couple's first child, returned home Wednesday morning, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of not being identified.\n\nColleagues of Weiner have said he wanted to wait until he could talk to his wife in person before making a decision on his career.\n\nA former adult film actress currently working as a stripper said she exchanged e-mails and Twitter messages with Weiner for more than two months. The woman, whose lawyer identified her as Ginger Lee, told reporters in New York on Wednesday that Weiner asked her to lie about it after the scandal broke.\n\n\"He asked me to lie about our communication,\" said the woman. She said she issued a three-sentence communication that said, \"I haven't met Representative Weiner. I follow him on Twitter because I support him and what he stands for. I have been hounded by his political opponents, but that has not changed my view of him and what he fights for.\"\n\nAfterward, she said, \"I did not want to say anything further. I refused to lie, so I went silent and went into hiding.\"\n\nOn June 2, she said, Weiner called her and told her that, if she said nothing to the news media over the following weekend, the story would die. \"I did what he told me to do,\" she said. \"But it did not.\"\n\nBy then, Lee said, her lupus was flaring, she needed the money she would have been making had she continued working and she had received \"threats\" from someone about releasing a statement that she had not authorized. Lee did not elaborate, but said she then arranged for lawyer Gloria Allred to represent her.\n\nAsked who had threatened her client, Allred said, \"I would rather not name the individual. He knows who he is.\"\n\nThough Lee said she initially admired Weiner for his views on Planned Parenthood and health care, her view of the congressman has changed. \"I think that Anthony Weiner should resign because he lied to the public and the press for more than a week,\" said Lee, who was working Wednesday night at a nightclub in Atlanta, Georgia. \"If he lied about this, I can't have much faith in him about anything else.\"\n\nAllred said her client had received about 100 e-mails from Weiner between March and two weeks ago, when they stopped.\n\n\"I have wardrobe demands too,\" the lawyer read from one. \"I need to highlight my package.\"\n\n\"All right, my package and I are not going to beg,\" read another. \"We both see the hazard of going down the path of comparative sexiness. At least with you, the intrusion ends after a few gawks. I get dragged into long commentary sessions at the corner bodega.\"\n\n\"You aren't giving my package due credit,\" read yet another.\n\nLee said she never reciprocated when he made suggestive comments.\n\nAllred said Lee, who is single, never met Weiner, never received any photographs from him and never sent him any. \"Overall, the e-mails were really not about sex,\" the lawyer said. In addition, the two talked only once, on the phone, she added.\n\nWeiner, who admitted sending lewd online messages and photos to women over the past three years, announced Saturday he is seeking treatment and requested a \"short leave of absence\" from Congress.\n\nTop leaders from both parties, including President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, have said or suggested that Weiner should step down over the controversy, which has been a major story since the news emerged in late May.\n\nA Democratic leadership aide insisted Wednesday night there was no specific move to start the ball rolling removing Weiner from the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe aide did say, \"There is a leadership meeting tomorrow to talk about a variety of subjects. And I am sure Weiner will come up.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a Democratic colleague of the New York congressman said that Weiner might resign \"in a couple of days.\" However, Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of New York did not say where she got her information.\n\nIn response to a question about whether Congress can get on with business if Weiner stays in office, McCarthy responded, \"We're going to find out. Hopefully. We're hearing that he might resign in a couple of days.\"\n\nRep. Diana DeGette, D-Colorado, said, \"If it were me, I would resign,\" but that the decision was up to Weiner and his constituents. Obama told NBC that he, too, would step down if he was in Weiner's position, while Boehner, R-Ohio, said Tuesday that Weiner should resign.\n\nRep. Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, declined to echo that call, citing his own scandal from the 1980s involving his relationship with a male prostitute who then used Frank's apartment to carry out his business.\n\n\"It's time for me to show a bit of a humility\" and not \"set myself up as the judge of others,\" Frank said.", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/06/15/weiner.scandal/", "published": 1308096000.0, "image": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/POLITICS/06/15/weiner.scandal/tzvids.abedin.tanzania.pool.jpg"}]}, {"title": "Hewlett-Packard to cut 9,000 jobs in $1 billion restructuring plan", "articles": [{"title": "Hewlett-Packard to cut 9,000 jobs worldwide", "body": "Hewlett-Packard cut 6,700 jobs last year to make savings\n\nHewlett-Packard (HP) says it plans to spend $1bn (\u00a3686m) and shed 9,000 jobs over three years as it creates fully-automated commercial data centres.\n\nHP, the world's largest technology company by sales, says the job cuts will be the result of productivity gains and automation.\n\nHP said the resulting \"next-generation services\" would benefit clients.\n\nThe firm said it would record a $1bn financial cost charge in the course of its 2013 financial year.\n\n\"As a result of productivity gains and automation, HP expects to eliminate roughly 9,000 positions over a multi-year period to reinvest for further growth and to increase shareholder value,\" it said.\n\nIt said the shake-up would make it annual gross savings of about $1bn and net savings \"after reinvestment in a range between $500m and $700m\".\n\nHP added that it would replace about 6,000 of the jobs that were lost, adding that the changes to the workforce would be made over time and would vary by country.\n\nAnd it said the commercial data centres would help its corporate clients run their businesses faster and more efficiently.\n\nThe latest job losses come after 6,700 posts were shed last year to make savings.", "url": "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/10205940.stm", "published": 1275350400.0, "image": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_10857/bbc_news_logo.png?cb=1"}, {"title": "HP to cut workforce by 3,000", "body": "HP to cut workforce by 3,000\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Hewlett-Packard plans to eliminate 3,000 jobs over the next few years as it ramps up its use of automated data centers for business customers, the company announced Tuesday.\n\nThe world's largest computer company said it will invest $1 billion in building up its automated data centers to service business customers. HP will cut about 9,000 jobs in its enterprise services division as a result, but over the same time period, the company expects to add about 6,000 employees to its sales and delivery teams.\n\nHP (HPQ, Fortune 500) will take a charge of about $1 billion to reflect the investment, and expects it to pay off in annual savings of about the same.\n\nAfter reinvesting some of that money, HP expects these moves to boost annual pre-tax earnings by between $500 million and $700 million by fiscal year 2013.\n\nHP significantly built up its business services division with its $13.9 billion acquisition of tech firm Electronic Data Systems in August 2008.

HPQ -0.34 % said it plans to shed about 9,000 workers from its technology-services division while investing $1 billion to modernize the unit, as it moves to jumpstart growth in an industry that's lagged the economic recovery.\n\nH-P's restructuring comes two weeks after the Palo Alto, Calif., company said quarterly revenue in its services division\u2014which runs computer systems for large companies and governments\u2014rose 2% from a year earlier but declined by 3% when adjusted for currency differences.\n\nIn contrast, other H-P divisions such as personal computers saw sales increase more than 20% year over year.\n\nRival International Business Machines Corp. IBM 0.21 % also reported relatively weak tech-services growth in its most recent quarter, with sales up 4% from a year earlier but declining 2% when adjusted for currency.\n\nThe slow growth in services is due to industry-wide shifts in how companies purchase tech services, said Peter Bendor-Samuel, chief executive of Everest Group, which consults with companies on tech-services decisions. Companies are looking to sign smaller, shorter outsourcing deals, rather than the multi-year contracts that previously were standard.\n\nTo profit on smaller deals, services providers have been trying to automate their offerings, replacing high-cost workers with software that performs certain functions automatically.\n\nTech services are crucial to H-P, which has bet big on the business. In 2008, H-P acquired outsourcing giant Electronic Data Systems for $13.6 billion, adding 142,000 workers. Since then, H-P has worked to trim EDS's costs, largely through a plan to lay off 25,000 workers. Tech services forms nearly a third of H-P's total revenue.\n\nThe 9,000 layoffs announced Tuesday are on top of the earlier 25,000 cuts, an H-P spokeswoman said, and represent about 3% of the company's overall work force, which stood at 304,000 in October.\n\nThe company is still in hiring mode and said it plans to bring on about 6,000 additional employees, largely in sales roles. H-P didn't say how many employees it has in the services unit or how many of the jobs being eliminated are in the U.S.\n\nWith Tuesday's announcement, H-P intends to boost profits and lower costs to customers by developing \"fully automated\" data centers, the giant computing rooms used to run corporate technology functions, said Ann Livermore, who heads H-P's services division.\n\nH-P's strategy of growing profit through acquisitions and layoffs is a hallmark of Chief Executive Mark Hurd. Since Mr. Hurd took over H-P in 2005, the company has repeatedly increased profit partly by paring down its expenses.\n\nIn mid-2005, Mr. Hurd announced a plan to cut more than 14,000 workers, or about 10% of H-P's work force at the time. Last year, during the recession, H-P announced plans to cut another 6,000 jobs and also instituted company-wide pay cuts.\n\nENLARGE\n\nIn a Tuesday conference call, Ms. Livermore said H-P has now \"closed the chapter on the EDS integration.\" She said H-P is now focused on growing its services division.\n\nThe unit runs tech systems for large companies. In some cases, clients outsource all of their computing functions, including email, data storage and corporate networks\u2014to H-P. In other cases, H-P takes over a limited set of functions, like processing health-care claims for state governments or reservation systems for airlines.\n\nBill Kreher, an analyst with Edward Jones, said H-P has \"revenue momentum\" that's outstripping competitors, even with the slow services growth. By investing in more highly automated services systems, he said, the company should be able to increase its services profits.\n\nThe services unit had earnings last quarter of $1.38 billion on revenue of $8.7 billion. The division's operating margin was 15.9% last quarter, up from 13.8% a year earlier.\n\nH-P plans to take a $1 billion charge over several years for the latest cuts. It expects the restructuring will generate $500 million to $700 million in annual savings.\n\nWrite to Justin Scheck at justin.scheck@wsj.com", "url": "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704875604575280211799521830.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsThird", "published": 1275350400.0, "image": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-IR856_hp0601_G_20100601203112.jpg"}]}, {"title": "US Congress House panel OKs big cut in public broadcasting funds", "articles": [{"title": "Panel Would Cut Public Broadcasting Aid", "body": "WASHINGTON, June 9 - A House Appropriations panel on Thursday approved a spending bill that would cut the budget for public television and radio nearly in half and eliminate a $23 million federal program that has provided some money for producing children's shows that include \"Sesame Street,\" \"Clifford the Big Red Dog,\" \"Between the Lions\" and \"Dragon Tales.\"\n\nBy a voice vote, the House Appropriations subcommittee adopted a measure that would reduce the financing of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the organization that directs taxpayer dollars to public television and radio, to $300 million from $400 million. The subcommittee also eliminated $39 million that stations say they need to convert to digital programming and $50 million for upgrading aging satellite technology that is the backbone of the PBS network.\n\nThe cuts in financing went significantly beyond those requested by the White House and are likely to be approved next week by the full Appropriations Committee and then by the House. Lobbyists for public television and radio say they hope to have the money restored in the version of the bill prepared by the Senate, where they have support from several senior Republican members. The final legislation will be the product of negotiations between the House and Senate.\n\nRepublican lawmakers said the cuts were not aimed at punishing public broadcasting but were the reality of preparing budgets at a time of growing deficits.\n\nBut Democrats took a different view.\n\n\"It is clear the G.O.P. agenda is to control public broadcasting or to defund it,\" said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. \"House Republicans have gutted funding for public broadcasting stations across the country.\"\n\nThe vote came as public stations and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are engaged in a debate over the editorial balance in programming and the independence of the stations.\n\nThe head of the Republican-controlled corporation, Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, has pressed public broadcasting to correct what he and other conservatives consider liberal bias. That has prompted public broadcasting leaders -- including the chief executive of PBS -- to object that his actions pose a threat to editorial independence.\n\nSome public broadcasting officials have begun to express concern that the perception of political interference by the corporation would discourage individuals from making financial contributions to the stations. Mr. Tomlinson, meanwhile, has said that the perception that the stations are not balanced could prompt the Republican-controlled Congress to significantly reduce financing.\n\nThe latest manifestation of the struggle between the stations and the corporation has arisen as the corporation searches for a new president. Mr. Tomlinson said in an interview in April that he had recommended that the board of the corporation appoint Patricia Harrison, a former co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee and assistant secretary of state, as the organization's next president. He has said he hopes the post will be filled at a board meeting later this month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut on Tuesday the Association of Public Television Stations sent Mr. Tomlinson a letter that endorsed an earlier one from Iowa Public Television that objected to the selection of \"a political partisan.\"\n\n\"We are concerned that the historical and critically important role of CPB as a shield between programming and a political process that seeks to influence it is being compromised -- in perception by reports of broad involvement in program content, or in fact by what we understand is a desire to appoint a partisan political activist to the currently vacant post of CPB president,\" the Iowa Public Broadcasting Board wrote. \"We believe strongly that such an appointment would be in absolute contradiction to the concept of CPB as a buffer. It would call into question the motivations of everything we do, whether funded by CPB or not.\"\n\nJohn Lawson, president of the Association of Public Television Stations, said that the subcommittee's decision to kill the Ready to Learn program, which provided $23 million for children's shows, came as payback for an episode earlier this year of \"Postcards From Buster,\" in which Buster visits a pair of lesbian parents in Vermont. PBS pulled the episode as it began to face complaints about it.\n\nOfficials at National Public Radio said rural and minority communities would be hardest hit by the cuts.\n\nJohn Scofield, a spokesman for the Appropriations Committee, said the cuts were not related to the \"Postcards\" episode that had prompted criticism.\n\n\"Ready to Learn was one of more than 50 programs terminated in the spending bill,\" he said. \"It might be a nice program to do, but not in a flat budget with large budget deficits. We felt the same way about 49 other programs.\"\n\nGary E. Knell, the president of Sesame Workshop, which produces \"Sesame Street\" and \"Dragon Tales,\" said the Ready to Learn program had contributed relatively modest amounts to the workshop and that most of the money for those shows comes from license revenue for the products sold by the workshop and money from stations.\n\nBut he said that the cuts in the program could undermine the workshop's plans to work with the Department of Education and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to develop new educational programs for 6- to 9-year-olds.\n\n\"This is the wrong time to be messing with this program,\" Mr. Knell said.", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/10/arts/television/10pbs.html", "published": 1118361600.0, "image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"}, {"title": "Congress Looks to Cut Funding for Public Broadcasting", "body": "Congress Looks to Cut Funding for Public Broadcasting\n\nHouse Republicans have put funding for public broadcasting on the chopping block. They say their action isn't related to ideological concerns. The move comes at a time when public broadcasters are confronting allegations of liberal bias.\n\nMELISSA BLOCK, host:\n\nYesterday a key panel in the US House of Representatives recommended deep cuts in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The CPB distributes taxpayer money to support public radio and television stations and programs. The committee's action comes as the head of the CPB has pushed for NPR and PBS to address what he says is the lack of journalistic balance in some of its news programs. NPR's David Folkenflik has the story.\n\nDAVID FOLKENFLIK reporting:\n\nTen years ago, Republicans who took over the House sought to eliminate funding for public broadcasting. Then Speaker Newt Gingrich argued it squandered taxpayer dollars on a bastion of liberalism. The movement failed. But it gained new life yesterday when a House subcommittee that decides how much money to give to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting each year decided to cut $100 million, a quarter of its annual budget, and there would be no extra money for necessary technical conversion to digital technology. The subcomittee's Republican chairman, Ralph Regula of Ohio, did not respond to requests for comment. Committee spokesman John Scofield would not speak on tape. But off microphone, Scofield said other government programs deserved higher priority than public broadcasting, and he noted the panel's decisions were part of a package making budget cuts in other social programs as well, in large part because of new costs associated with the Medicare prescription drug program. But some critics remained unconvinced.\n\nRepresentative DAVID OBEY (Democrat, Wisconsin): The message is think like we think and talk like we talk or we will defund you.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: That's Representative David Obey of Wisconsin. He's the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, and he says the cuts are driven purely by the ideology of conservative Republicans who don't like PBS and NPR.\n\nRep. OBEY: Eliminating their forward funding is nothing short of an attempt to send an intimidating message to the whole public broadcasting universe. I think it's pretty clear what's going on.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: The Senate has not yet passed its version of the spending bill, but it has tended to be more supportive of public broadcasting than the House. Through a spokeswoman, CPB chairman Kenneth Tomlinson said he was concerned about the cuts and hoped to work with Congress to regain the funding. NPR and PBS are private, not-for-profit entities that rely on CPB for money each year. At PBS, those funds help to pay for popular shows such as \"Sesame Street\" and \"The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.\" Pat Mitchell is the CEO of PBS. She says she believes the money will return before next year's budget is passed into law.\n\nMs. PAT MITCHELL (CEO, Public Broadcasting System): There have been efforts in the past to lessen the appropriations, and the wisdom has prevailed, and the funding has been restored. So we're confident that that's going to happen again.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: Money from CPB provides less than 1 percent of NPR's annual budget, but it represents 15 percent of the budget for individual NPR member stations. NPR's executive vice president, Ken Stern, argued in a memo to all NPR staffers that smaller public radio stations would suffer the most, like those that serve rural populations and minorities. And Stern partly blamed CPB chairman Tomlinson for what Stern said were, quote, \"irresponsible attacks on public broadcasting.\"\n\nTomlinson has been in the news a lot lately. He told The New York Times that he hopes to name a former chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, who is currently a State Department official, as the new president of CPB. He's publicly criticized PBS for what he says is its failure to provide ideological balance in some news programs. And Tomlinson's questioned NPR's coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Former NBC and CBS News correspondent Marvin Kalb is on an advisory group helping PBS to revise its journalistic standards for the first time in 18 years. But he says those standards should reinforce the independence of PBS.\n\nMr. MARVIN KALB (PBS Advisory Group): They should not be placed under unnecessary, unwarranted political pressures simply because the government provides a certain amount of money each year to make sure they run.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: The PBS board will meet next Tuesday to weigh the advisory group's recommendations. Many of the changes are technical, for example, addressing PBS Web sites that didn't exist in the 1980s. Others involve principles of journalistic responsibility. One key recommendation: that PBS' own standards be considered paramount for its news shows regardless of what the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or anyone else wants.\n\nPBS officials say the don't expect the updated code to be controversial. But Tomlinson and others at CPB have indicated that if they find PBS' journalistic standards wanting, they could be the ones to withhold money from PBS.

Autopsies performed Saturday morning showed Quadrevion Henning, 12, and Purvis Parker, 11, drowned, said Dr. Jeffrey Jentzen of the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's office. \"There was no evidence of any injury or any foul play that would lead us to suspect that there was any criminal activity,\" he said. Milwaukee Police Chief Nan Hegerty said: \"There has been no sign of foul play. We do not believe it was anything other than a tragic accident. \"Absent any additional investigation, this is a closed case at this time,\" she said. The boys were last seen March 19 as they headed to McGovern Park near their homes to play ball. Hegerty said police are not certain how the boys wound up in the park's lagoon but said there was speculation that Parker, who could not swim, fell in and Henning went in after him. She described Henning as a \"strong swimmer.\" Both bodies were fully clothed. The water at the time the boys disappeared was very cold, and in some spots icy, Hegerty said. The lagoon's deepest point is 20 feet. Hypothermia can set in almost immediately in icy water, as cold water can cause a person's heart to stop, Jentzen said. He estimated that death could have followed in 10 to 15 minutes. The boys likely were in the water before police were even notified that they were missing, Hegerty said. Parker's body was found floating on the water about 7:23 p.m. (8:23 p.m. ET) Friday by a man and his son who were walking through McGovern Park, and they called 911, Hegerty said. Divers found Henning's body about 9:45 p.m. The bodies were found on different sides of the lagoon, she said. Hegerty said divers failed to find the bodies during a search in March because the water was strewn with garbage and \"mucky.\" Also, she said, bodies tend to sink in cold water, and they could have been covered by silt. The park around the lagoon had been searched \"multiple times\" she said. A search on March 21 included police officers and search dogs, and volunteers and officers searched on foot March 23. Planes and helicopters with heat detectors also turned up nothing in another search, she said. \"As a parent, I cannot imagine anything worse than losing a child,\" said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. \"I have spoken to both families within the last hour. ... Both families, obviously, are very emotional. But both used the word 'closure,' and I think we recognize what they're saying: that the uncertainty is horrible.\" Early on Saturday the boy's family members told reporters that photos of the bodies they were shown on Friday night had convinced them the boys had been found. (Watch an uncle talk of 'closure' -- 1:19) Hegerty said police classified the search a criminal probe to enable authorities to bring in other agencies and resources they might not otherwise had been able to. When asked about possible precautions at the park aimed at preventing further accidents in the lagoon, Hegerty said the park was owned by the county, not the city. Routine toxicology testing was done as part of the autopsies, Jentzen said, and preliminary results should be available by the end of the week.

CBS/AP\n\nThe families of two missing boys said Saturday that their bodies had been recovered from a park lagoon near where they disappeared more than a month ago.\n\n\n\nPurvis Virginia Parker, 11, and Quadrevion Henning, 12, were last seen on the afternoon of March 19 when they asked Quadrevion's grandfather if they could play basketball at the nearby park.\n\n\n\nThe bodies were found in the park lagoon on Friday.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, it's my son,\" said Angela Virginia, who said she identified Purvis from a photo that police showed her.

In addition to the door-to-door searching, officers used dogs and thermo-imaging equipment to look for the boys, Schwartz said.\n\n\n\nThe department frequently gets reports of missing children, but they typically have a history of running away and turn up quickly, she said. The two boys do not have a history of running away.\n\n\n\nA Florida group called A Child Is Missing also had helped police in the search. The group called all home and business telephone numbers within a mile of where the boys were last seen and played a recorded message about the pair, officials have said.\n\n\n\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and America's Most Wanted also posted pictures of the boys on their Web sites.\n\n\u00a9 2006 CBS Interactive Inc.

It said that the boy, who lives in a slum in the capital Dhaka, had recovered after treatment. The government has always seen it as simply a matter of time before a person here was infected by the H5N1 virus. But still, the troubling thing is that the unnamed youngster was infected in the first place. Alarming rate The authorities say that he does not live on, or near a chicken farm, but in one of the capital's crowded and unhygienic slums. The health ministry says it will step up its monitoring of such places. After being first discovered in Bangladesh just over a year ago, bird flu has spread at an alarming rate - infecting chickens, ducks and wild birds in more than two-thirds of country's districts, as well as neighbouring parts of India. The impact has been massive, but until now, largely economic. According to government figures more than a million birds have been culled, $60m lost, and more than one and a half million people put out of work. Bird flu has been able to spread so quickly simply because there are so many people, and so many chicken farms squeezed together into this relatively small country. Some farmers complain that the government response has been hindered by a lack of resources and corruption.

A senior campaign aide said Gingrich's staff had begun reaching out to Perry's campaign \"aggressively\" in recent days. Gingrich himself had suggested on the campaign trail that it would be helpful for him if Perry were to drop out.\n\nStill, Gingrich's campaign has its hurdles. The candidate has come under scrutiny for his multiple marriages and past infidelity, and now his second wife, Marianne Gingrich, is saying the GOP presidential candidate wanted an \"open marriage.\"\n\nIs Newt Gingrich's surge for real?\n\nWhat do South Carolina voters want?\n\nIn a December debate, Perry said that marital fidelity is \"important\"to the presidential race, adding that \"he's always kind of been of the opinion that if you cheat on your wife, you'll cheat on your business partner.\"\n\nToday, Perry noted that he and Gingrich have \"had our differences... and Newt is not perfect, but who among us is?\"\n\n\"The fact is, there is forgiveness for those who seek God, and I believe in the power of redemption,\" he continued. \"I have no question Newt has the heart of a conservative reformer.\"\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Gingrich said he was \"humbled and honored\" to have Perry's support, calling him \"a leader for the cause of conservatism.\" He asked Perry's supporters to consider his record, saying, \"South Carolinians have a chance this Saturday to nominate a bold Reagan conservative who will offer a dramatic contrast with President Obama this fall in the general election.\"\n\nAt an event in Beaufort, South Carolina on Thursday, Gingrich said he spoke to Perry that morning and asked him to head up a \"10th Amendment enforcement project, reaching out to every governor in the country in both parties,\" as well as other elected leaders.\n\nGingrich said the project would result in a strong party platform plank on the 10th Amendment, which protects states' rights, as well as legislation on the issue.\n\n\"We can then pass that legislation no later than the end of the first quarter of 2013 to return power to the citizens, to communities, and the states and get it out of Washington, D.C.,\" he said.\n\nGingrich said Perry agreed to take on the project.\n\nPerry jumped into the presidential race last August to much fanfare, immediately surging to the top of the polls. But after multiple poor debate performances and campaign flubs, his campaign quickly began to flounder.\n\nPerry finished in a disappointing fifth place in the Iowa caucuses and finished sixth in the New Hampshire primary after opting to skip campaigning in the Granite state. Even though he ceded New Hampshire to focus on the more conservative state of South Carolina, polls have shown him stuck in the single digits and in last place there.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) AP\n\nGen. David Petraeus told Congress on Monday he envisions the withdrawal of roughly 30,000 U.S. troops by next summer, beginning with a Marine contingent later this month.\n\n\n\nIn long-awaited testimony, the commanding general of the war said last winter's buildup in U.S. troops had met its military objectives \"in large measure.\"\n\n\n\nAs a result, he told a congressional hearing and a nationwide television audience, \"I believe that we will be able to reduce our forces to the pre-surge level ... by next summer without jeopardizing the security gains we have fought so hard to achieve.\"\n\n\n\nPetraeus unleashed a volley of numbers to support his claim the surge is working, reports CBS News national security correspondent David Martin. He said the number of attacks in Iraq is lower than at any time in more than a year; civilian deaths are down by 45 percent; and sectarian killings are down by 55 percent.\n\n\n\nBut the charts show violence is still high, running at levels comparable to 2005, before the bombing of the Samarra mosque triggered sectarian fighting that nearly tore Iraq apart, adds Martin.\n\n\n\nTestifying in a military uniform bearing four general's stars and a chestful of medals, Petraeus said he had already provided his views to the military chain of command.\n\n\n\nRebutting charges that he was merely doing the White House's bidding, he said firmly, \"I wrote this testimony myself. It has not been cleared by nor shared with anyone in the Pentagon, the White House or the Congress.\"\n\n\n\nPetraeus' testimony came at a pivotal moment in the war, with the Democratic-controlled Congress pressing for troop withdrawals and the Bush administration hoping to prevent wholesale Republican defections.\n\n\n\nAmbassador Ryan Crocker, testifying alongside Petraeus, strongly suggested the administration's troop buildup had prevented a debacle.\n\n\n\nCrocker said 2006 was a \"bad year for Iraq. The country came close to unraveling politically, economically and in security terms. 2007 has brought improvement.\"\n\n\n\nBut Crocker, evaluating Iraq's ability to govern itself, the ultimate goal of the surge, has a lot fewer success stories to point to than Petreaus, reports CBS News chief White House correspondent Jim Axelrod, with a paralyzed parliament unable so far to pass major laws that would foster Sunni-Shiite reconciliation.\n\n\n\n\"I do believe that Iraq's leaders have the will to tackle the countries pressing problems, although it will take longer than we originally anticipated,\" said Crocker.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush and his political allies have worked forcefully in recent weeks to shore up Republican support. One organization with ties to the administration has spent millions on television advertisements, and Mr. Bush traveled to Anbar province last week to highlight improved security in the vast western stretches of Iraq.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush also called Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the hours before Petraeus spoke, and is expected to deliver a nationwide address on the war in the next few days.\n\n\n\nMr. Bush has urged lawmakers to listen to Petraeus with an open mind, but CBS News correspondent Chip Reid reports many influential Democrats said they already know what he's going to say and have already rejected it.\n\n\n\n\"The president's policy as well as his surge are not working,\" Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., told CBS News. \"The policy was to build up the Iraqi army so we could stand down. It's an abject failure.\"\n\n\n\nPetraeus said that a unit of about 2,000 Marines will depart Iraq later this month, beginning a drawdown that would be followed in mid-December with the departure of an Army brigade numbering 3,500 to 4,000 soldiers.\n\n\n\nAfter that, another four brigades would be withdrawn by July 2008, he said. That would leave the United States with about 130,000 troops in Iraq, roughly the number stationed there last winter when President Bush decided to dispatch additional forces.\n\n\n\nHe said he believes withdrawals could continue even after the 30,000 extra troops go home, but added that it would be premature to make any further recommendations.\n\n\n\nInitial reaction from Democrats was sour.\n\n\n\nRep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said it was a \"token withdrawal,\" and Petraeus rebutted him swiftly.\n\n\n\n\"A very substantial withdrawal,\" he countered.\n\n\n\nThe extent of any improvement in Iraq has been a matter of debate. The Government Accountability Office, a congressional agency, recently reported that Iraq has partially achieved only four of 18 political and military goals.\n\n\n\nAn administration report earlier this summer showed mixed results, as well.\n\n\n\nWhile Petraeus focused his remarks mostly on military matters, he also noted the failure thus far of the Iraqi government to take the actions needed to stabilize the country for the long term.\n\n\n\n\"Lack of adequate governmental capacity, lingering sectarian mistrust, and various forms of corruption add to Iraq's challenges,\" he said.\n\n\n\nUsing 13 pages of colorful charts, Petraeus conceded that the military gains have been uneven in the months since Bush ordered the buildup last winter.\n\n\n\n\n\nprev Next 1 / 2\n\n\u00a9 2007 CBS Interactive Inc.

Petraeus testified that the surge would last at least until next summer. This is simply unacceptable.\"\n\nShe added, \"The president's strategy in Iraq has failed.

Petraeus.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said, \"Our enemies around the globe gain great advantage by having the United States mired in an Iraqi civil war.\"\n\nKeeping troops in Iraq until at least July 2008 is \"not in the national interest of the United States,\" he said.\n\n\"The longer we keep over 130,000 troops in Iraq, the less incentive Iraqis have to engage in the needed political reconciliation and the longer we avoid dealing with several pressing threats to our national security,\" namely that Osama bin Laden remains at large, Reid said. See how much the war is costing \u00bb\n\nSkelton, D-Missouri, warned Petraeus and Crocker they were staring into a deep well of skepticism and frustration on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"I hope, Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, that you can persuade us that there is substantial reason to believe that Iraq will turn around in the very near future,\" Skelton said. \"But you have the burden of answering these fundamental questions to those of us who have been watching Iraq for years. And every promising development has so far not turned out to be the solution we hoped.\"\n\nSkelton said while U.S. troops have made tactical gains, particularly in the Sunni Arab province of Anbar, Iraqi leaders \"have not stepped up to the challenge\" of reaching a political settlement to the four-year-old war.\n\nBut Crocker said political gains in Iraq have been more pronounced at the provincial level than nationwide, and Iraqis have been taking practical action toward reconciliation even though they have been unable to set those steps into law.\n\nMilitarily, U.S. analysts have said the armed services will be unable to maintain the current level of more than 160,000 troops beyond next spring.\n\nPetraeus said one Marine expeditionary force would be coming home in September, and an Army brigade is slated to return in mid-December. He said four more brigades would be withdrawn by July 2008, leaving about 130,000 U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\nBut Petraeus said decisions on further withdrawals should be put off until mid-March.\n\n\"We will, no later than that time, consider factors similar to those on which I based the current recommendations, having by then, of course, a better feel for the security situation, the improvements in the capabilities of our Iraqi counterparts, and the enemy situation.\"\n\n\"The fact remains that the administration has sent you here today to convince the members of these committees and the Congress that victory is at hand,\" said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-California, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. \"With all respect to you, I don't buy it.\"\n\nThe Democratic leadership in Congress has been unable to force further reductions. In May, President Bush vetoed a call for U.S. combat troops to leave Iraq by April 2008.\n\nPetraeus commanded the Army's 101st Airborne Division during the 2003 invasion and spent a year training a new Iraqi military in 2004. He is considered a leading military scholar on counterinsurgency, and has tried to put those tactics to work to pacify Baghdad and its surrounding provinces.\n\nHe said military progress has been uneven, but the \"surge\" campaign launched in January is meeting its goals. And he said U.S. objectives in Iraq can still be met, \"although doing so will be neither quick nor easy.\"\n\nPetraeus said he wrote his testimony himself, and it had not been cleared by or shared with anyone in the White House or Pentagon. He said U.S. intelligence agencies consider the military's numbers \"the most accurate and authoritative in Iraq.\"\n\n\"We endeavor to ensure our analysis of that data is conducted with rigor and consistency, as our ability to achieve a nuanced understanding of the security environment is dependent on collecting and analyzing data in a consistent way over time,\" he said.

Last year he fell out with other leading members of al-Qaeda's franchise in the Sahara and formed his own jihadist organisation, calling it the Signed in Blood Brigade.

The drama of the hostage crisis has shot the hitherto unknown group Signatories in Blood and its leader Mokhtar Belmokhtar, variably referred to as an Islamist with ties to Osama bin Ladin and/or a senior al-Qaida leader, to notoriety overnight and has prompted western leaders to focus on the possibility of a growing threat of Islamist terrorism on Europe's southern border. Such tragic events are bound to provoke a strong reaction, yet, upon closer examination, it seems that the idea of a threat to mainland Europe is overstated.\n\nEven at a glance, the nature of the attack \u2013 hostage-taking for financial gain \u2013 is not the kind we have come to associate with al-Qaida over the years. Rather than reflecting the \"signature\" suicide attack with mass casualties, the event fits more appropriately into the series of other hostage-takings that have taken place in Algeria in recent years but which have not been on so grand a scale and hence have not gained the same attention as events at In Amenas.\n\nIt is not only the events which are different: the particular branch of al-Qaida to which they have been ascribed, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), formerly known as the GSPC (Groupe Salafiste pour la Pr\u00e9dication et le Combat \u2013 Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat) stands out for its focus on a local agenda. Although it has allegedly claimed that it supports Bin Ladin, the group, which was found to be responsible for car bombings that took place in Algiers in 2007, as well as a number of other local incidents, appears to be more concerned with overthrowing the Algerian government and the institution of an Islamic state in its place than with Bin Ladin's vision of the reestablishment of the caliphate and global jihad against the west.\n\nWhile it can be argued that the above is not entirely out of touch with al-Qaida's stated aims, it is nonetheless a return to the \"near enemy\" \u2013 the forces of occupation and secularisation \u2013 that have preoccupied Islamists for almost a century. While the AQIM's claim to be acting in the name of \"al-Qaida central\" feels very much like a convenient piece of flag-waving, current al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri declared in 2006 that America and France were the enemies, indicating a pragmatic approach by which senior al-Qaida leaders aim to flatter their local affiliates, enabling one side to continue to maintain the impression of its global reach while the other benefits from association with the infamous name. The true extent of any link or cooperative strategy, however, remains open to question.\n\nIf there is little evidence to suggest genuine cooperation between AQIM and the senior leadership of al-Qaida, the connection between al-Qaida and Belmokhtar and his Signatories in Blood is even more tenuous. Sometimes referred to as \"Marlboro man\" for his cigarette-smuggling exploits, Belmokhtar has a wide-ranging and impressive criminal career which includes drug trafficking, diamond smuggling and the kidnapping of dozens of westerners, such as diplomats, aid workers and tourists, for ransoms of up to $3m each. Yet Belmokhtar's success and growing influence were to be his downfall as far as his membership of AQIM was concerned.\n\nWhile his actions at In Amenas supposedly link Belmokhtar to al-Qaida in the eyes of the west, he in fact made the news on various jihadist forums for falling out with AQIM for his \"fractious behavior\", and either resigned or was formally dismissed from its ranks in late 2012. Such splintering is far from exceptional; indeed, it exemplifies the present state of al-Qaida.\n\nAl-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), operating in Yemen, and the recently formed Ansar al-Sharia are a case in point: despite their different names and agendas, the two groups are frequently referred to as one and the same and are conceived of as somehow representing a joint force. This bias amongst commentators towards presenting a united al-Qaida in various regions of the world is conducive only to resurrecting the popular, yet deeply flawed theory that al-Qaida operates on a global basis as a cohesive group, with all that this implies for the threat it poses to global security.\n\nToday more than ever before, al-Qaida and its local affiliates are highly fragmented and in disagreement as to their priorities of ideology and strategy. Indeed, the lines of fragmentation only begin here: beyond the increasing internal debate, al-Qaida and its local affiliates find themselves in direct contest with other, often more established Islamist groups with radically different worldviews and agendas, many of which now enjoy greater popularity because they are not so ready to spill the blood of their fellow Muslims.\n\nWhilst the existence of groups such as The Signatories in Blood and the dramatic, violent nature of incidents such as mass hostage-takings and car-bombings heightens fears in the west of a resurgence of the al-Qaida that caused so much death and destruction on 9/11, the truth is that most of today's al-Qaida franchises have a much more limited vision. Thus, when David Cameron announces that Britain must pursue the terrorists with an iron resolve, he unwittingly reinforces a notion of a unified Islamist threat that does not exist in that form. It is a convenient narrative which benefits both the propaganda machine of Islamists and the calls of those in the west who support military action, yet the true picture of those who claim to act in the name of al-Qaida \u2013 both in Africa and elsewhere \u2013 is far more nuanced, and much less of a threat to Europe, than we are commonly led to believe.\n\n\n\nChristina Hellmich is reader in International Relations and Middle East Studies at the Department of Politics and International Relations, University of Reading", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/22/algeria-islamist-threat-overstated", "published": 1358812800.0, "image": "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/17/1358430523646/Mokhtar-Belmokhtar--010.jpg"}, {"title": "Mali conflict: Rewriting the UN's best made plans", "body": "It took France the better part of a year to craft a UN-backed plan for dealing with the Islamist takeover of northern Mali that would avoid a French military intervention.\n\nIt took only a few hours to turn that project on its head.\n\nThe lightening deployment of French troops to stop an unexpected Islamist offensive left UN diplomats scrambling for answers and analysts scratching their heads.\n\n\"I think this is an amazing example of how a diplomatic process at the UN can take on a life of its own without any real reference to what's happening on the ground,\" says Richard Gowan of the New York University's Center on International Co-operation, who followed the talks closely.\n\nThe UN resolution outlines a months-long process of national reconciliation between the authorities in the capital Bamako and Malian Tuareg rebels in the north who cut ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups.\n\nIn parallel, European military trainers were tasked with rebuilding the Malian army - which collapsed in the wake of the northern rebellion last year - preparing it to join an African intervention force to take back the north from the Islamist extremists who now control it, sometime around September.\n\nDespite some scepticism from the Americans, the resolution passed unanimously in December.\n\nBut now, admits one Security Council diplomat, \"some of the assumptions will have to be rethought\".\n\nKey among those is the role of the Malian army, which to the alarm of diplomats here evaporated last week in the face of the advancing Islamist rebels.\n\nFlawed assessment\n\nThe resolution clearly underestimated the weakness of the army, envisioning instead that it would lead the joint offensive to the north.\n\nA greater number of African troops has now been pledged to join French forces\n\nSome Malian soldiers have since rallied to fight with the French, but the question is whether these can form the core of a reformed army, or whether \"we move over and have the Africans in the lead rather than the reverse,\" said the diplomat.\n\nAnother flaw was that the initial assessment of the armed groups underestimated their capability as what a senior French diplomat called a \"well armed, equipped, trained and determined\" force, which apparently tried to hold ground in terrain usually defined by skirmishes and ambushes.\n\nEven the political process was miscalculated.\n\nThe idea was to split the Tuareg rebels from foreign terrorist groups by addressing the political and economic grievances that had fuelled their rebellion, with the suggestion that the Islamists amongst the Tuareg, the Ansar Dine, would be willing to negotiate.\n\n\"The big question was about Ansar Dine,\" said another Security Council diplomat.\n\n\"The Algerians were saying it was possible to negotiate with them\u2026 so it was a shock to Algiers that Ansar Dine was part of the offensive.\"\n\nSceptical\n\nHowever, the unexpected changes on the ground have forced an accelerated deployment of African troops mandated by the UN resolution, pledged now in greater numbers than initially foreseen.\n\nBut given the upending of the UN framework it is not clear whether the deployment is legally based on the resolution or on a request for help from Mali, which is what undergirds the French military response.\n\nFrance is eager to hand the lead to the Africans as soon as possible, although the country's UN Ambassador Gerard Araud has acknowledged there are \"questions\" about how the shift from a French emergency operation to a UN mandate will take place.\n\n\"The resolution remains the context, the umbrella,\" he said, \"and the logic remains: bringing African forces, rebuilding the Malian army. But things have changed so at some moment we might have to see how to adjust its implementation\".\n\nOne factor that will influence this calculation is the size of the African force, and what sort of Western support it can get to overcome current deficiencies in funding, supplies and training.\n\n\"By bringing in the Africans it is possible that the French could at least partially pull out, and having won the initial battle, give the lead to the African contingent,\" says Mr Gowan.\n\nForeign forces in Mali Some 2,000 French troops on the ground in Mali, with 500 or more to come\n\nFrench Mirage and Rafale jets, Gazelle helicopters\n\nChad to send 2,000 troops\n\nNigeria to send 1,200 troops; Senegal, Burkina Faso, Niger and Togo expected to send 500 each, and Benin 650\n\nGhana and Guinea to also send troops\n\nUK providing two C17 cargo planes for French effort\n\nBelgium, Canada and Denmark also sending transport planes\n\nUS to provide communications help\n\n\"But it seems at a minimum if you wanted to do that you'd need a significantly larger force than envisioned, given the failure of the Malian army.\"\n\nAnother factor is what progress there will be in terms of a political process, likely to be pushed by the Americans and the Algerians to counter the logic of a military approach about which they have all along been sceptical.\n\nAt the moment, there is remarkable support for the French intervention, both in Mali and in the Security Council, but that could change with the nature of the operation, warns Mr Gowan.\n\nThe worst case scenario is that the French, supported by West Africans, get sucked into a battle of attrition with Islamists who switch to the tactics of a long-term insurgency, with huge implications for the region.\n\n\"Mali will not benefit from this intervention, and neither will Algeria,\" the Algerian analyst Ahmed Bin Gedo told the Financial Times recently.\n\n\"Some of the risks are that we enter a stalemate. It might end up being a decades-long war, resources will be lost, lives will be lost and it could also potentially spill over the border.\"\n\nFor the UN, the danger is that it might by default become the umbrella not for a nationally led offensive to reunite Mali's territory, but an operation ultimately seen as French aggression against a former colony.", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21138107", "published": 1358812800.0, "image": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/65428000/jpg/_65428798_65428797.jpg"}]}, {"title": "2007 Rugby World Cup: South Africa, Wales, Scotland and Ireland win", "articles": [{"title": "Wales 42-17 Canada", "body": "Wales finally won enough ball to allow their backs to show their class\n\nWales (9) 42\n\nTries: Parker, AW Jones, Williams (2), Charvis\n\nCons: Jones (4)\n\nPens: Hook (3) Parker, AW Jones, Williams (2), CharvisJones (4)Hook (3) Canada (12) 17\n\nTries: Cudmore, Culpan, Williams\n\nCons: Pritchard\n\n\n\nWales survived a huge scare in their opening World Cup match before overcoming a determined Canada side.\n\nCanada led 17-9 after 45 minutes in Nantes after tries from Jamie Cudmore, Craig Culpan and Morgan Williams.\n\nBut the introduction of Stephen Jones and Gareth Thomas sparked Wales to life as they dominated the last half hour.\n\nSonny Parker, Alun Wyn Jones, Colin Charvis and Shane Williams (2) crossed to ensure the victory which had looked a distant dream for the Welsh side.\n\nWales, wearing black armbands in honour of former Welsh Rugby Union president Sir Tasker Watkins who died on Sunday, lined up in unfamiliar grey jerseys.\n\nAnd the dullness of their shirts was matched by their play in the opening exchanges as they struggled to find any cohesion.\n\n606: DEBATE Gareth Jenkins is no clearer in knowing exactly his best XV\n\nBBC Sport's Nabil Hassan\n\nThey at least managed to force Canada to concede penalties in their own half, and James Hook kicked three of his four attempts to put Wales 9-0 up after 15 minutes.\n\nCanada's intentions were clear after picking a strong and experienced pack, and their opening try on 25 minutes all down to forward power.\n\nA scrum deep in Wales 22 provided the perfect attacking platform, and Cudmore eventually barged his way over from a few yards out as Wales buckled under heavy pressure.\n\nWales were left stunned 10 minutes later as Culpan ran almost the length of the field to score Canada's second try.\n\nWales had looked destined to score as a break by centre Tom Shanklin put Canada on the back foot, but Hook's attempted long pass was intercepted by Culpan and the centre had enough pace to race home.\n\nPritchard converted and the half-time whistle came as a blessing for the shell-shocked Wales players.\n\nThe break had little effect, though, as Canada scored their third try after just five minutes of the second-half.\n\nScrum-half Williams made the initial break before the Canada forwards again inched their way towards the Wales line with powerful drives.\n\nShanklin was Wales' most potent attacking threat in Nantes\n\nThe score looked inevitable, and it was Williams who finally borrowed his way through.\n\nWales needed a quick response, and coach Gareth Jenkins immediately turned to the experience of Thomas and Stephen Jones\n\nThe change had the desired effect as Wales finally came alive.\n\nJones almost scored with his first touch, a desperate Canadian covering tackle preventing the fly-half from grounding the ball as he dived over the tryline.\n\nBut the crucial score arrived moments later from the resulting scrum as Jones' reverse pass sent Parker over. Jones converted to bring Wales back to within a point.\n\nWales finally had the initiative, and they regained the lead five minutes later.\n\nA Canada clearance from behind their own tryline was charged down and lock Alun Wyn Jones pounced on the loose ball to score.\n\nWith the Canadians tiring, the outstanding Shanklin then had a hand in the next two Wales tries as Williams crossed twice in

Samoa (7) 7\n\nTries: Williams\n\nCons: Williams\n\n\n\nSouth Africa survived a brutal first-half battering by Samoa as they opened their World Cup campaign with an impressive victory in Paris.\n\nThe Springboks took a 9-0 lead before Samoa scored the first try of the match through Gavin Williams.\n\nBryan Habana and Percy Montgomery tries gave the Boks a 21-7 half-time lead.\n\nAnd further tries from Jaque Fourie, Montgomery, Habana - who claimed a second-half hat-trick - and JP Pietersen wrapped up a fine win.\n\nWith two of the most physical teams on the planet taking the field at the Parc des Princes the match always promised to be a bash-fest and so it proved as they combined to put on a thrilling opening 40 minutes.\n\nMan for man the Samoans could match their Springbok counterparts for power but in the tight phases of the game, the scrum and the line-out, the Springboks had a clear edge.\n\n606: DEBATE\n\nAnd it meant that, once they had weathered a ferocious opening half from the Samoans, the Springboks had control of the game.\n\nThe fired-up Samoans gave it a lash from the first whistle.\n\nFormer Leicester number eight Henry Tuilagi produced some ferocious charges, but poor discipline allowed Montgomery to make them pay with three penalties in the opening 15 minutes.\n\nThe opening 40 minutes was the most physical so far in France\n\nThe Pacific islanders' inability to secure their own ball at the line-out was costing them dear but when they finally managed some decent possession they opened the scoring with a superb try.\n\nQuick ball off the top was spun wide to inside centre Jerry Meafou and the timing of his pass sprung Williams through the South Africa midfield.\n\nThe Connacht centre outpaced the cover to score under the posts and he added the conversion to make it 9-7 to the Boks.\n\nThe quicker the pace of the game, the more dangerous Samoa looked, but the quickest man on the pitch was South Africa flyer Habana and his first real contribution to the game saw the Boks stretch clear.\n\nYou could see a lot of nerves from both sides early on the way they finished it off in the second half is a huge positive\n\nSouth Africa coach Jake White\n\nWhen he took Fourie's pass as the Boks attacked down the blind-side of a ruck there looked to be little on.\n\nBut the electric Blue Bulls winger carved infield before breaking free of a tackle and scything through the remaining defence for a superb solo try.\n\nMontgomery missed the fairly simple conversion but South Africa were soon back on the attack and after a series of attacking scrums Montgomery blasted through the final defender for the Springboks' second try.\n\nThe veteran full-back added the conversion to make it 21-7 at the break but Samoa came desperately close to cutting the gap when Iosefa Fekori plunged over straight after the restart, only to be pulled back for offside.\n\nLima is the first player to appear in five World Cups but was injured after producing a dangerous tackle\n\nSpringboks centre Jean de Villiers was helped off the field with an arm injury and was replaced by Francois Steyn.\n\nCoach Jake White later suggested the 26-year-old was a major doubt for the match against England on Friday, and possibly the whole tournament.\n\nIf Samoa's try had been awarded, they might still have been in with a shout but within little more than 10 minutes South Africa had cut loose with a quickfire try treble.\n\nFourie cut back against the grain to burst through the midfield and open his account for the tournament before Montgomery finished off a sweeping passing move to cross out wide.\n\nHabana then collected his second spectacular long-range score of the match, beating three men on a dazzling run to the line, and two Montgomery conversions meant South Africa suddenly led 40-7 after an hour's play.\n\nThe burst of scoring knocked the stuffing out of the Samoans and the pride they would have taken in the sight of 35-year-old Brian Lima coming on as a replacement would soon have evaporated.\n\nWhen he took the field Lima became the first man to play in five World Cups, but he soon got a high tackle horribly wrong, conceding a penalty in the process, and was helped groggily from the field.\n\nAs the game went on South Africa were happy not to pick up any injuries, while Habana confirmed his status as the world's most dangerous finisher with two more tries.\n\nMontgomery converted the first effort and the Springboks will head into Friday's encounter with faltering world champions England brim full of confidence.\n\n\"You could see a lot of nerves out there from both sides early on but all credit to our boys.\n\n\"The way they finished it off in the second half is a huge positive for us going forward in the competition.\"\n\n\"It seemed everything went against us and that try would have lifted us.\n\n\"We are that type of team, we need to have our tails up and if we had scored then I think it could have been a totally different story.\n\n\"I'm not saying we would've won but we wouldn't have conceded so many points.\"\n\nSouth Africa: Montgomery; Pietersen, Fourie, De Villiers, Habana; James, Du
