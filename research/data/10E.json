Alternatively, they may contact the airline or their travel agent to arrange a refund or rebook their travel plans.\n\nPassengers are advised to check www.ba.com before leaving for the airport.

However, biographers, friends and other students of his life dispute the finding and suggest his death was an accident.\n\nMany people have campaigned for years to win a pardon for Turing.\n\nDr Sue Black, a computer scientist, was one of the key figures in the campaign.\n\nShe told the BBC that she hoped all the men convicted under the anti-homosexuality law would now be pardoned.\n\n\"This is one small step on the way to making some real positive change happen to all the people that were convicted,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a disgrace that so many people were treated so disrespectfully.\"\n\nSome have criticised the action for not going far enough and, 59 years after Turing's death, little more than a token gesture.\n\n\"I just think it's ridiculous, frankly,\" British home computing pioneer Sir Clive Sinclair told the BBC.\n\n\"He's been dead these many years so what's the point? It's a silly nonsense.\n\n\"He was such a fine, great man, and what was done was appalling of course. It makes no sense to me, because what's done is done.\"\n\n'It's very wrong'\n\nLord Sharkey, a Liberal Democrat peer who wrote a private member's bill calling for a royal pardon in July 2012, said the decision was \"wonderful news\".\n\n\"This has demonstrated wisdom and compassion,\" he said. \"It has recognised a very great British hero and made some amends for the cruelty and injustice with which Turing was treated.\"\n\nVint Cerf, the computer scientist known as one of the founding fathers of the internet, also welcomed the development.\n\n\"The royal pardon for Alan Turing rights a long-standing wrong and properly honours a man whose imagination and intellect made him legendary in our field,\" he told the BBC.\n\nTechnology entrepreneur Mike Lynch added: \"Society didn't understand Alan Turing or his ideas on many levels but that was a reflection on us, not on him - and it has taken us 60 years to catch up.\"\n\nHuman rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: \"I pay tribute to the government for ensuring Alan Turing has a royal pardon at last but I do think it's very wrong that other men convicted of exactly the same offence are not even being given an apology, let alone a royal pardon.\n\n\"We're talking about at least 50,000 other men who were convicted of the same offence, of so-called gross indecency, which is simply a sexual act between men with consent.\"\n\nMr Tatchell said he would like to see Turing's death fully investigated.\n\n\"While I have no evidence that he was murdered, I do think we need to explore the possibility that he may have been killed by the security services. He was regarded as a high security risk,\" he said.\n\n'Not entirely comfortable'\n\nGlyn Hughes, the sculptor of the Alan Turing Memorial in Manchester, said it was \"very gratifying\" that he had finally been pardoned.\n\n\"When we set out to try and make him famous - get him recognised - it was really difficult to collect money,\" he said.\n\nBig screen Turing's life is the subject of upcoming Hollywood movie The Imitation Game, which focuses on the cracking of the Enigma code. Starring Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing, the film is due for release next year. Channel 4's TV film Codebreaker, about the highs and lows of Turing's life, was aired in 2011. And during the 2012 celebrations of the centenary of Turing's birth, a Welsh digital arts festival - the Abandon Normal Devices (AND) Festival - featured a laser image of Turing projected from Conwy Castle into the sky. Although Turing was born in London, he had strong connections with north Wales. The Italianate village of Portmeirion in Gwynedd was one of Turing's favourite places. But it was in northern England where Turing spent the last six years of his life, working at Manchester University in various specialist fields including mathematical logic and philosophy.\n\n\"None of the big computer companies would stump up a penny for a memorial. They perhaps would now - we've come a very long way.\"\n\nBut he said he was \"not entirely comfortable\" that Turing had been pardoned while thousands of other gay men had not.\n\n\"The problem is, of course, if there was a general pardon for men who had been prosecuted for homosexuality, many of them are still alive and they could get compensation.\"\n\nIn December 2011, an e-petition was created on the Direct Gov site that asked for Turing to be pardoned. It received more than 34,000 signatures but its request was denied by the then justice secretary, Lord McNally, who said Turing was \"properly convicted\" for what was at the time a criminal offence.\n\nPrior to that in August 2009, a petition was started to request a pardon. It won an official apology from the prime minister at the time, Gordon Brown, who said the way Turing was persecuted over his homosexuality was \"appalling\".", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25495315"}, {"published": 1387843200.0, "title": "Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing receives royal pardon", "image": "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/23/1387821035337/Alan-Turing-014.jpg", "body": "Alan Turing, the second world war codebreaker who took his own life after undergoing chemical castration following a conviction for homosexual activity, has been granted a posthumous royal pardon 59 years after his death.\n\nThe brilliant mathematician, who played a major role in breaking the Enigma code \u2013 which arguably shortened the war by at least two years \u2013 has been granted a pardon under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy by the Queen, following a request from the justice secretary, Chris Grayling.\n\nTuring was considered to be the father of modern computer science and was most famous for his work in helping to create the \"bombe\" that cracked messages enciphered with the German Enigma machines. He was convicted of gross indecency in 1952 after admitting a sexual relationship with a man.\n\nHe was given experimental chemical castration as a \"treatment\". His criminal record resulted in the loss of his security clearance and meant he was no longer able to work for Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), where he had been employed following service at Bletchley Park during the war. He died of cyanide poisoning in 1954, aged 41.\n\nAnnouncing the pardon, Grayling said: \"Dr Alan Turing was an exceptional man with a brilliant mind. His brilliance was put into practice at Bletchley Park during the second world war, where he was pivotal to breaking the Enigma code, helping to end the war and save thousands of lives.\n\n\"His later life was overshadowed by his conviction for homosexual activity, a sentence we would now consider unjust and discriminatory and which has now been repealed.\n\n\"Dr Turing deserves to be remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort and his legacy to science.

He also left a remarkable national legacy through his substantial scientific achievements, often being referred to as the father of modern computing.\"\n\nThere had been a long campaign to clear Turing's name, including a private member's bill. In 2009, an \"unequivocal apology\" was issued by then prime minister Gordon Brown. An e-petition calling for a pardon received 37,404 signatures when it was closed in November last year. The request was declined by the then justice minister Lord McNally on the grounds that Turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence.\n\nA pardon is normally granted only when the person is innocent of the offence and where a request has been made by someone with a vested interest, such as a family member. On this occasion, a pardon has been issued without either requirement being met.\n\nThere was mixed reaction to the announcement. Iain Standen, chief executive of the Bletchley Park Trust, said Turing was \"a visionary mathematician and genius whose work contributed enormously both to the outcome of the war and the computer age\".\n\nHe added: \"The pardon gives further recognition for his outstanding contribution not only to second world war codebreaking but also the development of computing.\"\n\nDr Andrew Hodges, tutorial fellow in mathematics at Wadham College, Oxford, and author of the acclaimed biography Alan Turing: The Enigma, said: \"Alan Turing suffered appalling treatment 60 years ago and there has been a very well intended and deeply felt campaign to remedy it in some way. Unfortunately, I cannot feel that such a 'pardon' embodies any good legal principle. If anything, it suggests that a sufficiently valuable individual should be above the law which applies to everyone else.\n\n\"It's far more important that in the 30 years since I brought the story to public attention, LGBT rights movements have succeeded with a complete change in the law \u2013 for all. So, for me, this symbolic action adds nothing.\n\n\"A more substantial action would be the release of files on Turing's secret work for GCHQ in the cold war. Loss of security clearance, state distrust and surveillance may have been crucial factors in the two years leading up to his death in 1954.\"\n\nWriter David Leavitt, professor of English at Florida University and author of The Man Who Knew Too Much: Alan Turing and the Invention of the Computer (2006), said it was \"great news\". The conviction had had \"a profound and devastating\" effect on Turing, Leavitt said, as the mathematician felt he was being \"followed and hounded\" by the police \"because he was considered a security risk\".\n\n\"There was this paranoid idea in 1950s England of the homosexual traitor, that he would be seduced by a Russian agent and go over to the other side,\" Leavitt said. \"It was such a misjudgment of Alan Turing because he was so honest, and was so patriotic.\"\n\nWith the situation in Russia regarding LGBT rights, and the recent decision by the supreme court in India to reinstate the criminalisation of homosexuality, \"for this to come from the Queen, is going to send a really important message, especially to the Commonwealth\", Leavitt added.Prof S Barry Cooper, professor of mathematical logic at the University of Leeds and chair of the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee, said: \"There was a slight worry that the private member's bill had got slightly bogged down. So this is fantastic. And a sign of the growing reputation of Alan Turing, a growing sense of what he did for this country and what so many other people at Bletchley Park did.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat peer Lord Sharkey, who introduced the private member's bill in the House of Lords, said: \"This has demonstrated wisdom and compassion. It has recognised a very great British hero and made some amends for the cruelty and injustice with which Turing was treated.\n\n\"It's a wonderful thing, but we are not quite finished yet. I will continue to campaign for all those convicted as Turing was, simply for being gay, to have their convictions disregarded. That will be a proper and fitting and final end to the Turing story.\"\n\nGay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said the royal pardon was long overdue, but also due to \"another 50,000-plus men who were also convicted of consenting, victimless homosexual relationships during the 20th century\".\n\nThough an inquest recorded a verdict of suicide, Turing's mother and others maintained his death was accidental.\n\nTuring made highly significant contributions to the emerging field of artificial intelligence and computing. After the war, he worked at many institutions, including the University of Manchester, where he worked on the Manchester Mark 1, one of the first recognisable modern computers.", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/24/enigma-codebreaker-alan-turing-royal-pardon"}, {"published": 1387843200.0, "title": "Alan Turing granted Royal pardon by the Queen", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02427/alanTuring3_2427431k.jpg", "body": "Alan Turing, the wartime codebreaker, has been granted a posthumous pardon by the Queen for his criminal conviction for homosexuality.\n\nDr Turing, who helped Britain to win World War II, killed himself after receiving the conviction in 1952.\n\nHe has now been granted a pardon under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy after a high-profile campaign supported by tens of thousands of people including Professor Stephen Hawking.\n\nDavid Cameron said: \"Alan Turing was a remarkable man who played a key role in saving this country in World War Two by cracking the German Enigma code.\n\n\"His action saved countless lives.

He also said the agreements under which U.S.-led coalition troops enjoy immunity from prosecution by Iraqi courts should be reviewed. \"We believe that the immunity given to members of coalition forces encouraged them to commit such crimes in cold blood (and) that makes it necessary to review it,\" Maliki told reporters in Kuwait. Maliki spoke two days after former Army Pfc. Steve Green was charged in federal court in Charlotte, with rape and four counts of murder. Green was held without bond. At least four other U.S. soldiers still in Iraq are under investigation in the attack, which occurred near the town of Mahmoudiya. In Baghdad, an American military spokesman stressed that the U.S. command was taking the allegations seriously and would discuss Maliki's demands when he returns from a tour of Persian Gulf countries. \"We are here as guests of the Iraqi government. They are a sovereign nation,\" Maj. Gen. William Caldwell said. \"When the prime minister gets back, the coalition will engage with him and discuss what he wants to discuss.\" Green and the four others were members of the same unit as two soldiers whose mutilated bodies were found June 19, three days after they were abducted by insurgents in Youssifiyah. A third soldier was killed before the others were abducted. But Caldwell said investigators had found nothing to indicate the June killings were retaliation for the rape-slaying. \"It appears they're very separate and distinct events that occurred, from what we've been able to find thus far,\" he said, adding the ongoing questioning of some 20 \"persons of interest\" has yielded no information that would link the two incidents. Both events, however, raised questions about procedures within the unit, which is part of the 101st Airborne Division but currently attached to the 4th Infantry Division. U.S. officials had said they were investigating how the three slain soldiers were left alone last month in an al-Qaeda-infested area. The alleged rape-slaying occurred after the soldiers left a checkpoint for the victims' house, according to court documents. In Mahmoudiya, Abeer's uncle said the family thought insurgents had been responsible until the U.S. military announced an investigation last week. \"Nobody knew who killed them,\" Ahmed Taha told AP Television News. \"Some said it was insurgents, and in fact, we ruled out the American troops.\" After the U.S. announcement, some neighbors told him of seeing U.S. soldiers in the area at the time of the attack but said they had been too afraid to come forward at the time. \"They were afraid of telling the truth, really, we were surprised by this news,\" Taha said, wearing a black checkered keffiyah as he stood near mounds of dirt and stone markers where the family of four was buried. Taha said he arrived at the scene about four hours after the killings and found the charred body of his 15-year-old niece, along with those of her mother, Fikhriya Taha, her father, Qassim Hamza, and her younger sister, Hadeel Qassim Hamza. Taha said the mother and father had been shot four times and showed signs of having been beaten. Abeer's 8-year-old brother, Ahmed Qassim, said he and his brother found the bodies when they came home from school. \"We found them dead in the house. We also found the house blackened and smoke coming from it,\" Ahmed said, holding a shovel and sitting near a mud puddle with a cow grazing behind him. The allegations emerged as Maliki's new national unity government was trying to promote a reconciliation plan to end the unrest. At least 24 people were killed Wednesday in attacks nationwide, including six who died in a a car bombing outside a Sunni mosque in a mostly Shiite area of northwestern Baghdad. Fourteen others were wounded in that attack, police said. Elsewhere, a suicide car bomber struck a new police station in Mosul, killing at least one person and wounding seven. Gunmen also killed a teacher near his home in eastern Mosul, and a barber shop was ambushed northeast of Baghdad, killing two civilians including the owner. Caldwell predicted an increase in vehicle bombings now that Abu Hamza al-Muhajer, also known as Abu Ayyub al-Masri, has succeeded the late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi as head of al-Qaeda in Iraq. Masri's specialty is car bombs, the general said. \"I think it would only be prudent for us to expect to see a rise in vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices ... given his specialty and background and training that we've seen that he's used,\" Caldwell said. The U.S. military reported 74 car bombs in the four weeks ending June 9, two days after Zarqawi was killed, compared with 125 in the four weeks since that date. Meanwhile, Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi said a group claiming to have kidnapped a Sunni legislator made several demands for her freedom: the release of all detainees, a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign troops and an end to attacks on Shiite mosques. Hashimi said the group contacted his Iraqi Islamic Party, but did not offer proof that it was holding lawmaker Tayseer al-Mashhadani. He said he believed she was still alive. Mashhadani and seven of her bodyguards were seized Saturday by gunmen at a checkpoint in a Shiite part of eastern Baghdad. The main Sunni political alliance has suspended its participation in parliament to demand her release. \"We call on you in the name of Islam to end her suffering,\" Hashimi said in a message to the kidnappers.

Such a move would be a direct rebuke to the Bush administration, which has fought tenaciously to ensure that American soldiers are exempt from local or international laws when serving on foreign soil.\n\n\"I'm about to talk to the multinational forces to reach solutions that will put an end to such practices,\" Mr. Maliki said of criminal behavior by soldiers. One possible course of action, he said, would be to \"revise the issue of immunity.\"\n\n\"Our people cannot tolerate that every day there is an ugly crime such as that in Mahmudiya,\" he added, referring to the market town near which the four Iraqis, including a young girl, were killed on March 12.\n\nMr. Maliki's assertion, which followed similar remarks he made in Kuwait on Wednesday, signaled the growing furor within the Iraqi government over the latest crime. The incident first became public last week, when the Fourth Infantry Division announced that it was investigating the involvement of American soldiers in the rape and slayings.\n\nThe rise in political tensions came as sectarian violence continued in Iraq. A suicide car bomber rammed his sedan into a Shiite shrine in the holy town of Kufa, killing at least 12 people, including five Iranians, and injuring dozens, Iraqi officials said. Iraqi and American forces have generally maintained tight security around the southern holy sites of Najaf and Kufa, to which Shiite pilgrims, including many Iranians, flock by the thousands.\n\nThe strongly worded apology issued Thursday night by the top American commander in Iraq, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., and Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad revealed the deep concern among American officials over the criminal episode's potential to damage the entire American project in Iraq.\n\n\"We understand this is painful, confusing and disturbing, not only to the family who lost a loved one, but to the Iraqi people as a whole,\" the two senior officials said in a written statement. \"The loss of a family member can never be undone. The alleged events of that day are absolutely inexcusable and unacceptable behavior.\"\n\nThe statement is all the more unusual because no soldiers have been convicted yet or even formally charged. On Monday, a recently discharged Army private, Steven D. Green, 21, was arrested in North Carolina on suspicion of rape and murder. Three soldiers, some of whom are reported to have admitted their roles in the crime to investigators, are confined to base in Mahmudiya, 20 miles south of Baghdad, and their weapons have been confiscated.\n\nMr. Green was moved Thursday to Louisville, Ky., where, in a half-hour hearing in which he pleaded not guilty, a federal judge ordered continued detention for him. Prosecutors said that Mr. Green, who was discharged from the Army in May before his suspected role in the case was discovered, is scheduled to be arraigned on Aug. 8 in Paducah, Ky.\n\nThe mayor of Mahmudiya, Mouayid Fadhil, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that American military investigators wanted to dig up the victims' bodies. But Iraq's Justice Ministry must first determine whether exhumation is allowed under Koranic law, he said. The victims' relatives are also reluctant to divulge the burial site out of shame over the fact that one of the dead, a girl as young as 15, was reported to have been raped by at least two American soldiers, the mayor said.\n\nSexual assault is considered one of the most heinous and shameful crimes in Muslim society; even mentioning the subject is often considered taboo. \"We don't want to talk about this,\" Mr. Fadhil said. \"She was raped.\"", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/07/world/middleeast/07iraq.html?_r=1&oref=login"}], "title": "US soldier arrested for rape and four murders in Iraq"}, {"articles": [{"published": 1321833600.0, "title": "Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi targets by-election seat", "image": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/56792000/jpg/_56792711_013358456-1.jpg", "body": "Aung San Suu Kyi may be an MP by the end of the year\n\nAung San Suu Kyi will try to win a seat in Burma's parliament in forthcoming by-elections, her party has confirmed.\n\nMs Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) have operated outside of the political system for years.\n\nThey won a landslide election victory in 1990 but the result was never recognised by the ruling generals.\n\nHowever, in recent days the NLD and the international community have given cautious praise to reforms undertaken by the current government.\n\nThe US announced it would sent Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the country for the first such visit in 50 years.\n\nAnd the regional political bloc Asean confirmed Burma had reformed enough for it to hold the chair of the group in 2014.\n\nSigns of change\n\nThe NLD announced on Friday that it was dropping its boycott of elections and would put up candidates for all 48 seats that have been available in a series of by-elections left vacant by reshuffles.\n\nMs Suu Kyi did not confirm whether she would be a candidate.\n\nHowever, on Monday, NLD official Nyan Win told reporters: \"Aung San Suu Kyi intends to stand for the by-election but it's a bit early to say from which constituency she will run.\"\n\nAnalysts speculated that Ms Suu Kyi could be an MP before the end of the year.\n\nThe NLD's 1990 election victory stunned the country's authoritarian rulers, and they refused to acknowledge the result.\n\nBurma suffered a period of intense repression after that election, and Ms Suu Kyi spent much of the following 20 years in jail or under house arrest.\n\nThe military junta eventually wrote a new constitution, which entrenched the power of the military.\n\nThey held a sham election last year that was boycotted by the NLD - the only opposition group strong enough to challenge the army.\n\nHowever, President Thein Sein - himself a member of the former ruling junta - has instituted enough reforms for observers to believe that real change may be taking place in the country.", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-15814790"}, {"published": 1321833600.0, "title": "Suu Kyi to stand in Myanmar elections", "image": "http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2011/11/21/201111214858176734_20.jpg", "body": "Former political prisoner to run in upcoming elections days after her party ends boycott of political system.\n\nDemocracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi commands considerable influence in Myanmar [Reuters]\n\nAung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's most prominent dissident, will run in an upcoming parliamentary election, a senior official in her party said, three days after her National League for Democracy (NLD) ended its boycott of the country's political system.\n\n\"Some people are worried that taking part could harm my dignity.

Frankly, if you do politics, you should not be thinking about your dignity,\" she said.\n\nThere are 48 parliamentary seats available but no polling dates have been set for elections.\n\n'Flickers of progress'\n\nSuu Kyi had previously not indicated whether she herself was interested in becoming a member of parliament, but her decision comes after Myanmar won a powerful endorsement on Friday when US President Barack Obama announced Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would visit the resource-rich country neighbouring China, citing \"flickers of progress\".\n\nClinton will be the highest-ranking American to visit the former British colony since a 1962 military coup.\n\nOn her two-day visit early next month she plans to meet with Suu Kyi, and has said credible elections are one condition for ending US sanctions, along with the release of more political prisoners and peace with ethnic minorities.\n\nThe NLD, which has been mostly suppressed since its election landslide in 1990, boycotted elections a year ago because of strict laws that prevented many of its members from taking part. As a result, the authorities officially dissolved it but it has continued to function and enjoys strong support from the public.\n\nMyanmar recently amended a political party law removing a clause barring anyone convicted of a crime from joining a party or taking part in an election, paving the way for those who had served a prison term, including Suu Kyi, to contest the polls.\n\nStrong influence\n\nSuu Kyi commands considerable influence over the party and Ko Ko Hlaing, a senior advisor to President Thein Sein, said on the sidelines of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Bali last week that the NLD's decision to re-register was a \"significant step\".\n\nThe presence of Suu Kyi in parliament would be another dramatic sign of openness that could give more legitimacy to the retired generals in charge of the country, who are eager to be accepted by the public at home and the international community.\n\nUnder the leadership of Thein Sein, the government has started a dialogue with Suu Kyi; a move welcomed by the West, which has imposed sanctions on the country because of its poor human rights record.\n\nThe government recently released more than 230 political prisoners, eased media censorship and sought guidance from international financial institutions to revive its economy.\n\nSource: Agencies", "url": "http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2011/11/2011112134741730400.html"}, {"published": 1321574400.0, "title": "Is Burma's political landscape changing for good?", "image": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/56791000/jpg/_56791279_013358061-1.jpg", "body": "Aung San Suu Kyi's party is rejoining the political process amid signs of change\n\nIf there was any lingering doubt about whether or not there is a process of change under way in Burma, this past week will surely have dispelled it.\n\nOn Monday opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi marked a year since her release from house arrest by delivering an overtly political speech. She described the past 12 months as \"eventful, energising and to a certain extent encouraging\".\n\nFour days later she and her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), backed that cautious optimism with concrete action by voting to re-register as a legal political party. The move opens the way for party members, including Aung San Suu Kyi, to contest a slew of forthcoming by-elections.\n\nJust over a year after boycotting a process it rejected as a sham designed to perpetuate military rule in civilian guise, the NLD and its iconic leader are choosing to move back inside the official system.\n\nIt was, according to NLD Vice-Chairman Tin Oo, \"a difficult decision taken after hard discussions\". That may be an understatement.\n\nThe decision to boycott last November's elections, the first since the NLD's unconsummated landslide win of 1990, led to a faction breaking away to form their own party to contest the poll.

Even the president of the United States felt he should call her - his first direct contact with the pro-democracy icon - before announcing that he was sending America's top diplomat, Hillary Clinton, to Burma in December.\n\nPresident Barack Obama outlined what he called the \"flickers of progress\" in recent weeks, making sure credit went in large part to his counterpart, Burmese President Thein Sein, seen as the main driving force behind recent reforms.\n\nREFORM IN BURMA 7 Nov 2010: First polls in 20 years\n\nin 20 years 13 Nov: Aung San Suu Kyi freed from house arrest\n\nfrom house arrest 30 Mar 2011: Transfer of power to new government complete\n\nto new government complete 14 Aug: Aung San Suu Kyi allowed to leave Rangoon on political visit\n\n19 Aug: Aung San Suu Kyi meets Burmese President Thein Sein\n\nThein Sein 6 Oct: Human rights commission established\n\ncommission established 12 Oct: More than 200 political prisoners freed\n\nfreed 13 Oct: New labour laws allowing unions passed\n\nallowing unions passed 17 Nov: Burma granted Asean chair in 2014\n\n\"We want to seize what could be a historic opportunity for progress, and to make it clear that if Burma continues to travel down the road of democratic reform, it can forge a new relationship with the United States of America,\" Mr Obama said.\n\nBut there are several steps that need to be taken before that point is reached - the release of all remaining political prisoners, resolving the armed conflicts which persist in some areas, addressing the rights of Burma's ethnic minorities and ensuring the fair and independent application of the rule of law.\n\nRegional body Asean clearly thinks Burma is moving in the right direction. Its decision to award its historically recalcitrant member the rotating chair of the organisation in 2014 is both reward for steps taken thus far and encouragement to keep it up.\n\nDerek Tonkin, a former British ambassador in the region says: \"They (Asean) have also made it clear that they are looking for steady progress from now on. They are taking a risk, but they feel they have good reason to do so.\"\n\nSceptics will view all this with alarm, arguing that nothing that has changed in Burma so far is set in stone. The hawks, the military, could still bring these nascent signs of reform to a shuddering halt.\n\n\"You are never going to get that 'irreversible' assurance which Western countries say they are seeking,\" says Derek Tonkin. \"There is bound to be some occasional backsliding, but provided the general trend is in the right direction, that is the best we can hope for.\"\n\n'Practical help'\n\nThere appears now to be a consensus developing around that view and on the need to bolster and encourage the direction of travel.\n\nAung San Suu Kyi seemed to offer some guidelines towards the end of her speech earlier this week.\n\nIn it she appealed to all those who wish Burma well, to help by \"criticising us when necessary, encouraging us at the right time and, if I may request it, providing us with practical help when we need it\".\n\nThe first and second steps are being fulfilled.

In addition to the eight deaths, 23 people were hurt, U.S. Major General William Caldwell said in a statement, without giving details. The statement was read over the phone by a spokeswoman.\n\nAl-Qaeda in Iraq is claiming responsibility for the attack, Time magazine reported. An unidentified Interior Ministry official told Time that the bomber was a guard for one of the members of Parliament.\n\nPrime Minister Nuri al-Maliki called today's attack a ``criminal and cowardly act,'' in a statement read on state television. ``This savage act will not weaken the will of the representatives of the Iraqi people,'' al-Maliki said.\n\nHadi al-Amiri, head of the Parliament's security and defense committee, said on al-Arabiya television that the bomb went off just after a legislative meeting had broken up.\n\n`Catastrophe'\n\n``Had they been able to place this bomb inside the meeting hall, it would have been a catastrophe,'' al-Amiri told al-Arabiya, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMohammed Awad of the Sunni Muslim National Dialogue Front, which holds 11 seats in Iraq's legislature, was killed in the attack, AP reported, citing party leader Saleh al-Mutlaq.

Media requires JavaScript to play. The former US Democratic presidential contender, John Edwards, has endorsed Barack Obama's bid for the White House. Speaking alongside the senator at a rally in Michigan, Mr Edwards said Mr Obama was the one man who could make the lasting change that America needed. John Edwards dropped out of the presidential race in January. Correspondents say his endorsement will damage Mr Obama's rival, Sen Hillary Clinton, despite her victory in the West Virginia primary on Tuesday. 'Bold leadership' \"The Democratic voters in America have made their choice and so have I,\" John Edwards told a crowd of cheering supporters in Grand Rapids, Michigan. \"There is one man who knows and understands that this is a time for bold leadership... there is one man who knows in his heart that it is time to create one America, not two - and that man is Barack Obama.\"\n\nEdwards plays kingmaker card Mr Edwards spoke about the need to help the poor and provide better health care, and announced that Mr Obama had backed his new anti-poverty initiative, which aims to reduce poverty in the United States by half within 10 years. Earlier in the speech he paid tribute to Hillary Clinton's tenacity, strength and determination, and said she cared deeply about the working people of America. Correspondents say the timing of the announcement is significant, on a day when Hillary Clinton has been celebrating a big win in West Virginia which was largely down to her support among poorer white voters - a constituency with which John Edwards is most closely identified. 'Far from over' Both Senators Obama and Clinton had been heavily courting Mr Edwards' endorsement, as soon as he had stood down from the race in January. But as news of the announcement broke, Mrs Clinton's campaign team dismissed its significance. Hillary Clinton had a big win in West Virginia on Tuesday \"We respect John Edwards, but as the voters of West Virginia showed last night, this thing is far from over,\" Clinton campaign chairman, Terry McAuliffe, said in a statement. So far in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr Obama has won more of the delegates who will choose the party's nominee at the Democratic National Convention this summer. He has also raised more money than Mrs Clinton. The Clinton campaign has been hoping that she could pick up more endorsements than Mr Obama from the so-called \"super-delegates\", who get an automatic vote at the convention by virtue of holding a senior position in the party. The BBC's Justin Webb says that with the high-profile endorsement of Mr Edwards, Mrs Clinton's already difficult case has just become even trickier to make. According to a tally by the Associated Press, Barack Obama has a total of 1,887 delegates, leaving him just 139 delegates short of the 2,026 needed to clinch the nomination, while Hillary Clinton has 1,718 delegates.\n\n\n\nE-mail this to a friend Printable version Bookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?", "url": "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7401899.stm"}], "title": "John Edwards endorses Barack Obama"}, {"articles": [{"published": 1281052800.0, "title": "Senate confirms Elena Kagan to Supreme Court", "image": "http://i.usatoday.net/marketing/email/_notches/email-promo-most-popular.jpg", "body": "Enlarge By Jack Gruber, USA TODAY Elena Kagan prepares to testify on the second day of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington on June 29.\n\nWASHINGTON \u0097 Chief Justice John Roberts will swear in Elena Kagan as the nation's 112th Supreme Court justice on Saturday, making women one-third of the nation's highest court for the first time in history.\n\nSupreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Roberts telephoned Kagan to offer \"warm congratulations\" Thursday, shortly after the Senate confirmed her.

One Democrat, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, voted no.\n\nCritics accused Kagan of being short on courtroom experience and holding liberal views on abortion and gun control. In Kagan, the president has appointed \"someone who shares his progressive, elitist vision and is willing to advance it from the bench,\" warned Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is the Judiciary Committee's top Republican.\n\nKagan will be the first member of the court since the Chief Justice William Rehnquist to arrive without previous experience as a judge.

Under questioning from Republican senators, however, Kagan would not commit to recusing from a potential legal challenge to the administration's health care plan.\n\nSen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Kagan will be a \"great antidote\" to a court that he described as being dominated by \"judicial activism of the right.\"\n\nHowever, Kagan is not expected to change the court's ideological balance, which tilts 5-4 in favor of conservatives. She's replacing retired justice John Paul Stevens, leader of the liberal wing.\n\nAfter the vote, Sen.

Alito Jr., nominated by President George W. Bush, with only four endorsing him in a 58-to-42 vote in January 2006.\n\nMost Senate Republicans challenged Ms. Kagan\u2019s nomination until the end, asserting that she lacked sufficient experience and had unfairly stigmatized the military by supporting a bar on recruiters at Harvard Law over the military\u2019s policy against allowing gay men and lesbians to serve openly.

However, Nairobi appears to have decided that its proxy war across the border was not working and has sent an occupation force instead.\n\nThe move could have drastic consequences for famine relief efforts as Kenya said yesterday that no more Somali famine refugees would be allowed to cross into camps in northern Kenya. Aid workers and UN staff around the Somali town of Dhobley, which has been the staging post for efforts to feed hundreds of thousands of starving people, were expected to be evacuated today.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, one senior aid official warned that the military operation \"could backfire on humanitarian efforts\".\n\nFamine-blighted Somalia has been carved into warring enclaves over the past two decades and international attempts to deliver peace through backing individual factions have all ended in failure. \"Ethiopia went in four years ago and made speedy progress to Mogadishu,\" said Roger Middleton, a regional analyst from the Chatham House think tank. \"What they faced was an intense guerrilla war that drove them out and left behind a worse situation than before.\"\n\nThe military push follows the abduction in northern Kenya of four foreigners in the last two months by Somali gunmen. Al-Shabaab, which has lost territory during the Horn of Africa famine and is under pressure from African Union troops and rival militias in south and central Somalia, has not claimed responsibility for the kidnappings.\n\nAl-Shabaab responded to Kenya's move yesterday by calling for a holy war: \"Are you ready to live under Christians?\" one al-Shabaab official shouted on a radio station in southern Somalia. \"Get out of your homes and defend your dignity and religion.

Those countries have a history of civil war and relatively active armies, while Kenya is known for its mild foreign policy and is one of the few nations in the region that has never been led by a military man.\n\nAccording to Kenyan security officials, several hundred Kenyan soldiers crossed into Somalia in a column of armored trucks and tanks, backed by helicopters, which have begun to bomb and strafe Shabab positions. More Kenyan soldiers are apparently on their way.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going all the way to Kismayo,\u201d said one Kenyan security official, referring to a Shabab-controlled port city in southern Somalia. \u201cWe\u2019re going to clear the Shabab out.\u201d\n\nA Somali military commander said warplanes carried out airstrikes on Shabab bases in southern Somalia, Reuters reported, but he could not confirm that the aircraft were Kenyan.\n\nThe Shabab are a ruthless insurgent group; they have pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda and have become masters of suicide bombs, slaughtering countless civilians in their own country and scores of pub-goers in Uganda in July 2010, apparently as a reprisal for Uganda\u2019s involvement in Somalia. Many Kenyans are now concerned that the Shabab may try to kill Kenyans or some of the hundreds of thousands of tourists who flock to see the country\u2019s fabled wildlife parks each year.\n\n\u201cIt worries me,\u201d said John Githongo, a political analyst and former Kenyan government official.\n\nA Shabab attack is \u201coverdue, to be very grimly honest,\u201d he said, adding that Kenya\u2019s decision to wade into Somalia was only going to raise the risks.\n\nThe Kenyan government has justified its actions, blaming the Shabab for a recent string of kidnappings of Westerners in Kenya. On Saturday, George Saitoti, Kenya\u2019s internal security minister, announced that Kenyan forces would begin hitting back, even though many analysts have said that the kidnappings were not the work of the Shabab but of Somali bandits and pirates.\n\n\u201cOur territorial integrity is threatened,\u201d Mr. Saitoti said. \u201cIt means we are now going to pursue the enemy, who are the Al-Shabab, to wherever they will be.\u201d\n\nKenyan security forces have intervened in Somalia before, back in the 1960s, when Somalia tried to foment an uprising in the ethnic Somali parts of Kenya along the border. More recently, the Kenyan Army, which is trained by British and American advisers, has been aiding Somali militias along the border in an effort to push back the Shabab, who control much of southern Somalia, and create a buffer zone. Occasionally, small contingents of Kenyan troops have crossed into Somalia, though the maneuvers were usually covert, with the government covering up casualties.\n\nBut Mr. Githongo and others could not remember a time when Kenyan forces had so overtly intervened in a neighboring country.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no precedent,\u201d Mr. Githongo said.\n\nAl Qaeda terrorists have shown they can strike in Kenya, blowing up the United States Embassy in Nairobi in 1998 and bombing a tourist hotel in Mombasa, on the Indian Ocean coast, in 2002. Some of the terrorists involved in those attacks later hid in Somalia, which has been mired in various stages of anarchy since the central government collapsed in 1991.", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/world/africa/kenyan-forces-enter-somalia-to-battle-shabab.html"}], "title": "Kenya troops enter Somalia after kidnappings"}, {"articles": [{"published": 1245974400.0, "title": "Obama praise for Iran's Mousavi", "image": "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45979000/jpg/_45979709_mousavi_getty226b.jpg", "body": "Mr Mousavi had become the protesters' representative, Barack Obama said US President Barack Obama has praised the opposition candidate in Iran's disputed presidential election. Mr Obama said Mir Hossein Mousavi had captured the imagination of groups in Iran that were interested in opening up to the world.

Mr Obama's comments came hours after foreign ministers from the G8 nations issued a statement \"deploring\" the post-election violence in Iran. In Iran itself, a spokesman for the powerful Guardian Council - which is due to give its final ruling on the election on Sunday - said there had been no election fraud. And a member of Iran's top clerical body urged the judiciary to deal ruthlessly with the leaders of the protests. Some 17 people are thought to have died in street protests in the past two weeks, and Tehran has imposed severe restrictions on journalists and the internet. Rights group Amnesty International called on Iranian leaders to release more than two dozen journalists arrested since the polls.

Eerie calm masks Iran tensions Before the G8 issued its statement, a spokesman for Iran's top election body, the Guardian Council, said the vote had been fair. \"We have had no fraud in any presidential election and this one was the cleanest election we have had,\" Abbasali Kadkhodai told Irna news agency. Meanwhile, a senior hard-line cleric said in his Friday sermon that the leaders of the protests should be dealt with \"severely and ruthlessly\". \"I want the judiciary to... punish leading rioters firmly and without showing any mercy to teach everyone a lesson,\" Ahmad Khatami told worshippers at Tehran university in comments broadcast nationwide.\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

Like an onion the speech got sharper as the layers of his message were peeled away. The mass demonstrations in Tehran and elsewhere this week were declared illegal. The explicit threat to unleash the thugs and hardmen of the Basij militia was made and reiterated.\n\nIt is a measure of the gravity of the challenge the Islamic Republic faces that Mr Khamenei chose to go on a direct attack against his opponents. Not just against the \"Zionists and British,\" but the only active Iranian leaders who could be considered his peers.\n\nThe demonstrations in favour of presidential challenger Mir-Hossein Musavi were declared to be a threat to the Islamic Republic. The elections may have encompassed mistakes, he conceded, but a gap of 11 million votes - in favour of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Holocaust denying president - was infallible.\n\nWhile careful not to attack Mr Musavi, the sermon was a direct assault on his credibility. The two men have history. As president and prime minister the men, both members of Persia\u2019s Azeri ethnic minority, fought a long power-struggle that Mr Mousavi eventually lost in the late 1980s.\n\nBut it was a lengthy discourse on former president Hashemi Rafsanjani that sealed the faultlines of a battle for supremacy that is likely to dictate Iran's future. He rubbished bazaar criticism of Mr Rafsanjani for corruption, only to implicate the Rafsanjani family as \"problematic.\"\n\nAs head of the Assembly of Experts, a college of clerics that elects the Supreme Leader, Mr Rafsanjani is theoretically the only man who could depose Mr Khamenei. He has reportedly sought a quorum for it to meet this week.\n\nEither that happens and Mr Rafsanjani makes his move or Supreme Leader will be free to break his opponents by unleashing the myriad guard forces built up since the 1979 as a cordon for the clerics.\n\nAll else was rhetoric. Nasty. Xenophobic. Designed to sow doubt, suspicion and hatred across Iran. He lashed out in bizarre tangents. He twisted Barack Obama\u2019s carefully worded expression of neutrality. The US leader was two-faced - on the one hand writing letters requesting friendship and on the other waiting for the regime to fall.\n\nHe blamed the British media for fanning the flames of demonstrations. He said there were foreign spies instigating riots and \"burning the possessions of the people.\"\n\nHe drew cheers when called on God to protect the boat from the termites.
