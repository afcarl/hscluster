Police and local residents rescued 46 people, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping hope alive that more survivors will be found,\u201d De los Santos said, adding Navy and Coast Guard teams arrived today to help in search and rescue operations.\n\nThe vessel capsized in choppy waters because it was overloaded, Transportation Undersecretary Maria Elena Bautista said in a phone interview. The ferry\u2019s authorized capacity was 40 passengers, she said, adding the owner and her daughter were identified among the dead.\n\nMany Filipinos take ferries to travel between the nation\u2019s 7,100 islands. Stormy weather and lax regulation have been blamed for accidents, including a collision that killed 4,000 people in 1987, the world\u2019s worst peacetime shipping disaster.\n\nIn June, the MV Princess of the Stars capsized in the central Philippines, leaving as many as 800 dead. More than 50 people died in two ferry sinkings in November.\n\nAparri is on the north of the island of Luzon and about 427 kilometers (265 miles) north of Manila.

Most probably his parents perished with him.\"\n\nDe los Santos said coast guard and navy vessels joined the search for 33 people still missing, but bad weather was hampering the effort.\n\nCoast guard chief Vice Adm. Wilfredo Tamayo said criminal charges will be filed against the owner and surviving crew members of the 28-ton Maejan, which was authorized to carry only 50 people.\n\nHours before the ferry capsized, three children fell into the sea as the vessel was lashed by huge waves, Calayan Mayor Joseph Llopis said. Two of the children were plucked alive, but it was not clear if they survived the final capsizing, said Llopis, who lost 10 of his relatives in the disaster.\n\nThe accident was especially tragic because many of the passengers from his town of 17,000 people were traveling to Aparri to buy food and other goods ahead of Christmas, Llopis said.\n\n\"There'll be no festive mood,\" Mr Llopis said. \"Many of the dead were breadwinners.\"\n\nLast month, a cargo ship sank in rough seas north of Cagayan, and passing vessels plucked 16 of 20 people from shark-infested waters. Weeks earlier, separate storms capsized two passenger boats in the central Philippines, drowning more than 50 people.\n\nSea accidents are common in the Philippine archipelago because of tropical storms, badly maintained boats and weak enforcement of safety regulations.\n\nIn December 1987, the ferry Dona Paz sank after colliding with a fuel tanker, killing more than 4,341 people in the world's worst peacetime maritime disaster.\n\nThe state weather bureau over the weekend warned of an approaching storm from the Pacific with winds of up to 60 miles (95 kilometers) per hour.\n\nTropical Storm Dolphin could become a typhoon before getting closer to the eastern Philippines in the next few days, according to forecasts.

They include tightening ethics rules for lawmakers, raising the minimum wage, allowing more research on stem cells and cutting interest rates on student loans.\n\nBut instead of allowing Republicans to fully participate in deliberations, as promised after the Democratic victory in the Nov. 7 midterm elections, Democrats now say they will use House rules to prevent the opposition from offering alternative measures, assuring speedy passage of the bills and allowing their party to trumpet early victories.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the Californian who will become House speaker, and Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, who will become majority leader, finalized the strategy over the holiday recess in a flurry of conference calls and meetings with other party leaders. A few Democrats, worried that the party would be criticized for reneging on an important pledge, argued unsuccessfully that they should grant the Republicans greater latitude when the Congress convenes on Thursday.\n\nThe episode illustrates the dilemma facing the new party in power. The Democrats must demonstrate that they can break legislative gridlock and govern after 12 years in the minority, while honoring their pledge to make the 110th Congress a civil era in which Democrats and Republicans work together to solve the nation's problems. Yet in attempting to pass laws key to their prospects for winning reelection and expanding their majority, the Democrats may have to resort to some of the same tough tactics Republicans used the past several years.\n\nDemocratic leaders say they are torn between giving Republicans a say in legislation and shutting them out to prevent them from derailing Democratic bills.\n\n\"There is a going to be a tension there,\" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the new chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \"My sense is there's going to be a testing period to gauge to what extent the Republicans want to join us in a constructive effort or whether they intend to be disruptive. It's going to be a work in progress.\"\n\nHouse Republicans have begun to complain that Democrats are backing away from their promise to work cooperatively. They are working on their own strategy for the first 100 hours, and part of it is built on the idea that they might be able to break the Democrats' slender majority by wooing away some conservative Democrats.\n\nDemocrats intend to introduce their first bills within hours of taking the oath of office on Thursday. The first legislation will focus on the behavior of lawmakers, banning travel on corporate jets and gifts from lobbyists and requiring lawmakers to attach their names to special spending directives and to certify that such earmarks would not financially benefit the lawmaker or the lawmaker's spouse. That bill is aimed at bringing legislative transparency that Democrats said was lacking under Republican rule.\n\nDemocratic leaders said they are not going to allow Republican input into the ethics package and other early legislation, because several of the bills have already been debated and dissected, including the proposal to raise the minimum wage, which passed the House Appropriations Committee in the 109th Congress, said Brendan Daly, a spokesman for Pelosi.\n\n\"We've talked about these things for more than a year,\" he said. \"The members and the public know what we're voting on. So in the first 100 hours, we're going to pass these bills.\"\n\nBut because the details of the Democratic proposals have not been released, some language could be new. Daly said Democrats are still committed to sharing power with the minority down the line. \"The test is not the first 100 hours,\" he said. \"The test is the first six months or the first year. We will do what we promised to do.\"", "image": "http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/images/twp-50x50.jpg", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/01/AR2007010100784.html"}, {"published": 1167696000.0, "title": "Milestones at Home and in Iraq", "body": "Milestones at Home and in Iraq\n\ni itoggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nRarely have so many historical milestones been crowded into so tight a time frame.\n\nIn these last days of 2006 and first of 2007, we have eulogized a former president who left office 30 years ago \u2014 a symbol of an era now far enough in the past to be recalled fondly.\n\nIn these same days, Saddam Hussein was hanged in Baghdad \u2014 ending his life and career but not the warring that was his legacy. Within the same weekend, the number of U.S. service personnel killed in Iraq passed 3,000.\n\nAnd in this week, we also swear in the first Democratic Congress in a dozen years, elected in large part because voters were exasperated by the war in Iraq.\n\nEven the United Nations is turning a historic corner, installing South Korean Ban Ki-Moon as its first new secretary-general in a decade.\n\nSo it would be fitting if President Bush came forward this week with a milestone of his own, a speech announcing a new direction in Iraq that actually included a new direction for U.S. policy there.\n\nWe have been promised such a speech for a nearly a month now, with the delivery date steadily receding. It now appears the president may address the nation before mid-January on the subject.\n\nBut the president has not shown a great eagerness to make this speech. He has conducted weeks of preparatory chats with advisers, most of whom have been advising him for years. He has also let it be known that he is leaning toward a marginal escalation \u2014 committing more U.S. troops to the war. These would not be fresh troops so much as Iraq war veterans extending their current tours or returning to the region sooner than planned.\n\nThis idea, known in administration parlance as a troop surge, has the virtue of constancy. It would maintain the commitment the United States has made over the past four years to establishing a Western-style democracy in Iraq. It keeps faith with the promises the president has made to the government of Nouri al-Maliki, the people of Iraq, the American public and the families of U.S. military personnel. The president often says that the families of fallen U.S. soldiers tell him to \"finish the job\" so as to honor their sacrifice.\n\nThe surge would also signal the White House's attitude toward the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, and this too may be seen as a virtue within the president's inner circle. The ISG was a 10-member bipartisan commission, carefully chosen by Congress to assess the situation. The panel's leading figure, former Secretary of State James Baker, was practically the alter ego of the first President Bush. He was to ensure that the commission got to the bottom of things and that its report would go right to the top.\n\nBut the ISG's bitter prescriptions have not found favor in the White House. The panel chose to nudge the president toward a strategy of negotiation and withdrawal, hoping its report would become a milestone in its own right by enabling the White House to make a turn toward the realistic.\n\nPerhaps the panel's rejection of the previous course was stated too starkly. And the powerful Baker connection may have been counterproductive. Talk of a \"Baker Regency\" in the last two years of this presidency, combined with magazine covers showing the current president as a foundering, miniature version of his father, may have poisoned the well.\n\nFor now, we wait. But as the weeks have stretched on through the holidays, another milestone of sorts has been achieved. The support for the president's policy in Iraq has reached its lowest ebb to date. Public support as measured in the polls has reached historic lows. And the willingness of prominent Republican senators to question the war has reached an unprecedented high.\n\nThe Republican turnaround has been unmistakable on the question of the troop surge. Although the idea is backed by Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina \u2014 both longtime advocates of larger deployments \u2014 it has not found many other friends in the Senate.\n\nIn fact, several Republicans who have recently returned from the region have distanced themselves from the idea, including Susan Collins of Maine and Norm Coleman of Minnesota. Both face the voters in 2008 in states that voted against Bush in 2004.\n\nBut even in red states, there have been Republicans voicing their doubts. Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, long the senior Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, has said he is undecided about the surge. And the usually stalwart Saxby Chambliss of Georgia has said that higher troop levels must have a specific mission that they would achieve and then \"get out.\"\n\nThe increasing frequency with which that phrase is heard in Washington may be a milestone in itself.", "image": "http://media.npr.org/news/images/2007/jan/02/getty/bush_conf200-aad72235299a6f677f7d70c16a06e40e6ff0d546-s800-c15.jpg", "url": "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6710614"}]}, {"title": "British trade union general secretary Bob Crow dies at 52", "articles": [{"published": 1394496000.0, "title": "Bob Crow, RMT union general secretary, dies", "body": "Mr Crow had been RMT leader since 2002\n\nRail Maritime and Transport union leader Bob Crow has died at the age of 52 of a suspected heart attack.\n\nLeading the RMT from 2002, Mr Crow became one of Britain's most high-profile union leaders.\n\nUnion, industry and political figures have been paying tribute to him.\n\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson, who often clashed with him, said Mr Crow had \"fought tirelessly\" for his members.

In death, those who once condemned him and who he regarded as his enemies - Tory cabinet ministers, the Mayor of London and, yes, the leader of the Labour Party - have lined up to praise him (though in the case of Ed Miliband not on camera) as a fighter for those he regarded as his people. Crow, in my experience, was simply unmoved by the views of the political and media establishment. Few doubt that he was not just one of the best known but also one of the most effective trade union leaders in terms of doing the job he was paid to do: protecting the job security of his members, increasing their pay and improving their conditions. Behind the public displays of aggression was a man, it is widely said, who was willing and capable of striking a deal in private. This was a man who knew what he thought, knew whose side he was on and knew who the enemy were in an era when that can be said of a shrinking number of people in public life.\n\nWhile he was supported by his members, Mr Crow was often criticised by some politicians and parts of the media when the union decided to take industrial action - sometimes to the consternation of London's commuters.\n\nJust last month thousands of Tube passengers endured delays because of strike action over planned job cuts and ticket office closures.\n\nMr Johnson said: \"This was a guy who really fought for his members and who stuck up for his point of view.\n\nBob Crow was a vocal campaigner against the war in Iraq\n\n\"Obviously I didn't always agree with what he had to say but... together with other union members, Bob Crow unquestionably helped to drive through huge progress on London Underground, and he leaves a massive legacy behind.\"\n\nMr Johnson's predecessor Ken Livingstone said: \"If you think in terms of what's a tribute to him, I can't think of any other job that working class people do that's got good wages and conditions and a pension - all the others have been eroded.\"\n\nTransport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said Mr Crow had made \"an important contribution to the debate around the future of rail services in this country\".\n\nMr Miliband said Mr Crow had been \"a major figure in the Labour movement and was loved and deeply respected by his members\".\n\nHe added that Mr Crow had been a \"passionate defender of and campaigner for safe, affordable public transport\" and a \"lifelong anti-fascist activist\".\n\n\"I didn't always agree with him politically but I always respected his tireless commitment to fighting for the men and women in his union.\"\n\n'Feared by employers'\n\nMr Crow leaves a partner, Nicola Hoarau, and four children.\n\nBorn in 1961 in east London, he got his first job on the underground at the age of 16, fixing rails and cutting down trees by the track.\n\nHe became a local representative for the then National Union of Railwaymen at the age of 20, rising through the ranks before becoming general secretary of the RMT - which was formed by the combining of the National Union of Railwaymen and the Seamen's Union in 1990.\n\nLast month, Mr Crow joined his members on the picket line during the Tube strike.\n\nManuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, which also took part in the strike, said: \"Bob Crow was admired by his members and feared by employers, which is exactly how he liked it.\n\n\"It was a privilege to campaign and fight alongside him because he never gave an inch.\"\n\nMr Crow did not attend a TUC executive away day on Monday because he felt unwell.\n\nHis older brother Richard told Sky News he believed the union leader had suffered a heart attack early on Tuesday, and paid tribute to the \"loveable little rogue\".\n\n\"We grew up together in Chigwell in Essex and he was a very likeable chap - no matter what people said about his politics,\" he said.\n\n\"He was honest, he looked after the people he was supposed to look after, and he was a great man as far as honesty and beliefs went.\"\n\nHe added: \"When people have a high office in life they fall for the big trappings of the flash cars and the big hotels and big houses. But Bob wasn't like that, he was a genuine person of the people.\"\n\n'Gobby'\n\nIn an interview broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on the day before he died, Mr Crow described himself as \"talkative\", but said he did not like to be \"gobby\".\n\nWorkers at Covent Garden Tube Station paid tribute to Bob Crow\n\n\"At the end of the day, to be a general secretary of a union you've got to be larger than life,\" he said.\n\n\"[You can't] walk around with a grey suit on and eat a cheese sandwich every lunch time.

In later years, the shaven-headed, Millwall-supporting Crow was easily caricatured in the rightwing press \u2013 particularly during tube strikes or when his union demanded, and won, Olympic bonuses for workers. But while he was unafraid to call a strike, associates remember him as a shrewd negotiator who knew when to settle and how to play his hand.\n\nHis defiance over his well-publicised cruise holiday to Brazil on the eve of the recent tube strike was typical: why, he asked, wasn't a working man allowed to spend his money on a holiday? It had been advertised in the Daily Mail.\n\nIn one of his last interviews, he told the BBC: \"At the end of the day, to be the general secretary of a union you have to be larger than life. I wouldn't want to walk around in a grey suit and eat a cheese sandwich every lunchtime.

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA union, which had joined the dispute with the RMT, said he was \"proud and privileged to have stood alongside Bob\". He added: \"While many bosses might not have said it in public, he carried their respect. He understood that his job was to get the best possible deal for his members. That is what he always did.\"\n\nThe offices of the RMT union were closed on Tuesday.

The only working-class people who still have well-paid jobs in London are his members.\"\n\nHe said Mr Crow was \"broadly right on most key issues\" and that if more people had fought for the conditions of the working classes \"this country would be a much better place.\"\n\n\"With the passage of time people will come to see that people like Bob Crow did a very good job,\" he said.\n\nThe RMT confirmed Mr Crow's death \"with the deepest regret\".\n\nA brief statement said: \"It is with the deepest regret that RMT has to confirm that our general secretary Bob Crow sadly passed away in the early hours of this morning.\n\n\"RMT would request that all media respect the privacy of the friends and family of Bob Crow at this distressing time.\"\n\nMr Crow was most recently involved in a controversial Tube worker's strike over plans to close ticket offices on the London Underground.\n\nCrow's trade union career saw him frequently at loggerheads with management and the government. He became assistant general secretary of the RMT in 1991, before being elected leader in 2002.\n\nUnder Mr Crow's leadership, membership of the RMT increased by more than 20,000 to 80,000, embracing workers ranging from seafarers and rail staff to cleaners.\n\nHe spoke at rallies and meetings most weekends, and was always in demand to support campaigns.\n\nA former member of the Communist Party of Great Britain and the Socialist Labour party his hard left rhetoric was often criticised by those on the right and the centre left.\n\nMr Crow was regarded as a member of the so-called \u201cAwkward Squad\u201d - the loose grouping of left-wing union leaders who came to power in a series of electoral victories beginning in 2002.\n\nMr Crow's death caused shockwaves in the trade union movement and across the political spectrum.\n\nManuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, who stood on picket lines with Mr Crow during last month's Tube strike, said: \"Bob Crow was admired by his members and feared by employers, which is exactly how he liked it.\n\n\"It was a privilege to campaign and fight alongside him because he never gave an inch.\"\n\nSir Peter Hendy, London's Transport Commissioner, said: \"We are shocked by this terribly sad and unexpected news. Our thoughts are with Bob Crow's family, friends and all those he represented.\"\n\nUK Independence Party (Ukip) leader Nigel Farage tweeted: \"Sad at the death of Bob Crow. I liked him and he also realised working-class people were having their chances damaged by the EU.\"\n\nMr Crow had been campaigning for the No2EU political party in May's European elections, arguing that workers were suffering because of policies from Europe.\n\nMr Crow's older brother, Richard Crow, said he believed the union leader had suffered a heart attack in the early hours of today.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, he paid tribute to the \"loveable little rogue\".\n\nRichard, whose father was also a trade union leader, said: \"It's very sad.\n\n\"It was about 7am that I got the call (from my sister). I presume some time in the night he had some problems. We're really trying to find out exactly what happened.\n\n\"We grew up together in Chigwell in Essex and he was a very likeable chap - no matter what people said about his politics.\n\n\"He was honest, he looked after the people he was supposed to look after, and he was a great man as far as honesty and beliefs went.\n\n\"He was a person who believed in justice.\"\n\nTube workers at Covent Garden station pay tribute to Bob Crow Ed Miliband said: \"Bob Crow was a major figure in the labour movement and was loved and deeply respected by his members.\n\n\"I didn't always agree with him politically but I always respected his tireless commitment to fighting for the men and women in his union. He did what he was elected to do, was not afraid of controversy and was always out supporting his members across the country.\n\n\"He was a passionate defender of and campaigner for safe, affordable public transport and was a lifelong anti-fascist activist.\n\n\"My thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues in the RMT and wider union movement at this difficult time.\"\n\nIn a statement, London Mayor Boris Johnson said: \"I'm shocked. Bob Crow was a fighter and a man of character.\n\n\"Whatever our political differences, and there were many, this is tragic news.\n\n\"Bob fought tirelessly for his beliefs and for his members.\n\n\"There can be absolutely no doubt that he played a big part in the success of the Tube, and he shared my goal to make transport in London an even greater success. It's a sad day.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said: \"The Prime Minister expresses his sincere condolences to Mr Crow's family and friends.''", "image": "http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article9107583.ece/binary/original/v3-bobcrow.jpg", "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bob-crow-dies-rmt-union-leader-dead-at-52-9183607.html"}]}, {"title": "Al Jazeera airs new Osama Bin Laden tape", "articles": [{"published": 1137628800.0, "title": "English", "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (Xinhuanet) -- Analysts at the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) believed that the voice on a tape, aired earlier Thursday by Arab television station Al Jazeera, was that of Osama bin Laden, an agency official said. The official, speaking anonymously, said that following technical analysis, the CIA determined that the voice on the tape was that of bin Laden, chief of the al Qaeda terrorist organization. Bin Laden warned in the tape that attacks were under preparations against the United States and its allies, and offered a truce in response to U.S. public opinion favoring withdrawal American troops from Iraq. \"We don't mind offering you a long-term truce on fair conditions that we adhere to,\" he said in the tape. He said both sides could \"enjoy security and stability under this truce so we can build Iraq and Afghanistan, which have been destroyed in this war.\" Speaking on the Fox News channel, Vice President Dick Cheney said he believed the truce offer was a ploy and that it was too early to draw any conclusions. \"I'm not sure what he's offering by way of a truce. I don't think anybody would believe him ... It sounds to me like it's some kind of a ploy, but again not having seen the entire text or validated the tape and the timing of it, I'm reluctant to draw any conclusions,\" he said. At a luncheon speech in New York on Thursday, Cheney warned that the United States still faced significant threats from terrorists attempting to establish a radical Islamic empire. White House spokesman Scott McClellan said President George W. Bush had been informed about the tape, and that the United States would not negotiate with terrorists. \"Clearly the al Qaeda leaders and other terrorists are on the run, they're under a lot of pressure. We do not negotiate with terrorists, we put them out of business,\" he said. The Department of Homeland Security had no plan to raise the country's security alert level in response to the tape, department officials said.

And despite all the things we say about him being isolated and alone, he can clearly dominate the international media when he wants to.\"\n\nAs in the past, the Islamist radical is also believed to be sending a message as much to the Muslim world as to the United States.\n\nRecommended: Could you pass a US citizenship test?\n\nIn a brief audiotape aired Thursday on Arab television station Al Jazeera, the speaker scoffs at claims that US antiterrorism measures are the reason no more attacks have hit the US since Sept. 11, 2001. Instead, the speaker says, further attacks are in preparation and \"you will see them in your houses as soon as they are complete, God willing.\"\n\nIn a new twist, the speaker refers to rising US public opinion against the war in Iraq and says, \"We have no objection to responding to this with a long-term truce.\" In an April 2004 tape, bin Laden offered Europe a truce - a move some analysts saw at the time as an effort to exploit a divide among Western allies over Iraq and antiterrorist measures.\n\nIn the same way, bin Laden might be trying to take advantage of what he sees as divisions in the US - although some analysts caution against reading more into the latest tape than a basic desire to reaffirm that the terrorist leader is alive and well.\n\n\"He's saying that whatever measures we've taken, they have not affected him,\" says Judith Yaphe, a former CIA Middle East analyst now at the National Defense University in Washington. \"He's got to reassure people that he's alive and well.\"\n\nExperts in South Asia, where bin Laden is assumed to remain in hiding, agree.\n\n\"There has been this long discussion in the media - is Osama bin Laden alive, is he dead, why hasn't he spoken, et cetera? So this is probably a reaction to that,\" says Ahmed Rashid, author of \"The Taliban\" and a longtime observer of jihadist groups in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nOf course, if the voice on the tape does turn out to be confirmed as bin Laden's, it does not necessarily prove that bin Laden is unaffected by US and other counterterrorism measures aimed at him and other Al Qaeda operatives.\n\n\"It's extremely easy for him to get a message out like this,\" says Mr. Scheuer, the former US intelligence analyst. \"It can be delivered from anywhere in the world\" but still appear as though he is doing just fine. On a tape, he adds, \"a pup tent can be made to look like a palace.\"\n\nStill, the tape holds particular messages - both to the US, in the form of an offered \"truce,\" and to the Muslim world, Scheuer says.\n\nThe truce offer is not unlike the overture bin Laden made to Europeans in April 2004, he says.\n\n\"[The] Madrid [bombings] came first [in March 2004], then he offered the truce, and then there were the London bombings,\" Scheuer says. \"So I think we have to take him at his word here.\"\n\nBut then there is his message to Muslims. One goal is probably to reconfirm bin Laden's standing among Muslims as a leader.\n\n\"This says, 'I am the equal of George Bush,' \" Ms. Yaphe notes, in the sense of a global player able to make a decision with global impact.\n\nOther experts agree, noting that whatever Al Qaeda leaders may be trying to communicate to the US, they - like all wartime leaders - first and foremost are speaking to the homefront.\n\n\"Their real message is meant for consumption by their followers and potential recruits,\" says Brian Jenkins, a terror expert at the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, Calif. \"It says, No. 1, Osama bin Laden is still in charge. By his communications, by him saying he has been busy preparing operations ... his offer of a truce - all of these are an assertion of leadership.\"\n\nBeyond that, Mr. Jenkins adds, \"It says he is in operational control,\" something that has been widely debated among analysts. \"What [Bin Laden] is saying here is not only is he the leader, but that he also runs operations.\"\n\nScheuer says the truce offer \"is perfectly consonant with Islamic history. Muslim leaders from the Prophet to Saladin were ready to make a temporary [truce] with the infidels if they thought it would benefit Muslims.\" The point, he adds, is that \"this will resonate very loudly in the Islamic world.\"\n\nIn the tape, the speaker refers specifically to a truce to allow a rebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"What they would love, of course, is if we would just back out of Afghanistan and Iraq,\" Scheuer says, in part to allow the reestablishment of the Islamic caliphate to begin there.\n\n\"For the caliphate to be built, they have to have a political state from which to start,\" he says. \"That's why Al Qaeda valued the Taliban so much. Now they view Iraq in the way they viewed Afghanistan.\"\n\nWith the new tape surfacing on the heels of this week's CIA-directed attack on suspected Al Qaeda strongholds in Pakistani tribal areas, some observers speculate the tape may be an effort to establish Al Qaeda's operability after the attack. But Mr. Rashid says that is unlikely.\n\n\"I don't see how he could have reacted so quickly to the recent Predator attack,\" he says, referring to the unmanned craft that was used to carry out the bombing.\n\nIn any case, Rashid says information about the effects of the raid is so confused that it is looking less like a counterterrorist triumph even without bin Laden's input.\n\n\"The problem is that the story in the media, as told by the Pakistani government, keeps changing so many times\" he says. \"The latest story is that they killed the son of [Ayman] Zawahiri [the Al Qaeda No. 2 leader], but in the villages they say it was all local people.\"\n\nIn the future, he adds, \"this could damage America's ability to say in the end, 'We got him.' \"\n\n\u2022 Staff writer Scott Baldauf in New Delhi contributed to this report.\n\nA chronology of statements attributed to bin Laden\n\nArab television station Al Jazeera aired a new audio tape Thursday said to be from Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The last message from him was in December 2004.\n\nFollowing is a chronology of major statements attributed to Mr. Bin Laden or his deputy Ayman al-Zawahri in the past year or so. The statements were aired on Al Jazeera, via audio or video tapes, unless otherwise noted.\n\nDec. 27, 2004: Bin Laden urges Iraqis to boycott January's elections, saying anyone who takes part is an \"infidel.\" He praises attacks in Iraq by ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\n\n2005\n\nFeb. 10: Mr. Zawahri says Iraqi elections held under foreign occupation are a sham.\n\nFeb 20: Zawahri says governments cannot stop Al Qaeda attacks, and the security of the West depends on respect for Islam and an end to aggression against Muslims.\n\nJune 17: Zawahri says reform and the expulsion of \"invaders\" from Muslim states cannot happen peacefully. Reform must be based on Islamic law, and Muslim states should be free to govern themselves without interference or the presence of foreign troops, he says.\n\nAug. 4: Zawahri warns Britons of more attacks. He also tells Britain and the US they will not have peace until they pull their troops out of Iraq and other Muslim nations.\n\nSept. 19: Zawahri says Al Qaeda carried out the July 7 transit bombings in London to strike at \"British arrogance.\" He denounces Britain for \"the historical crime of setting up Israel and the continuing crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq.\"\n\nOct 23: Zawahri urges Muslims to help Pakistan's earthquake victims though its government is a US \"agent.\" He denounces Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf.\n\nDec 24: Zawahri praises the Taliban in an audio tape aired by Al Arabiya television, saying the Islamic movement still controls large parts of Afghanistan.\n\n2006\n\nJan. 6: Zawahri says President Bush's plans to withdraw troops from Iraq meant Washington had been defeated by the Muslims.\n\nJan. 19: Bin Laden warns that Al Qaeda is preparing new attacks inside the US, but says the group is open to a conditional truce with Americans.\n\n- Reuters", "image": "http://www.csmonitor.com/extension/csm_base/design/csm_design/images/csm_logo_1200x630.png", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0120/p01s01-usfp.html"}, {"published": 1137628800.0, "title": "CIA authenticates tape, bin Laden promises more attacks in U.S. 'soon'", "body": "Osama bin Laden (AP file Photo)\n\nAn audiotape from Osama bin Laden has been aired on Al-Jazeera television, with a chilling warning for the United States.\n\nThe CIA has authenticated the voice on the tape as that of bin Laden, an agency official said.\n\nAddressing the American people directly, bin Laden declares that new attacks on the United States are being prepared and \"you will see them in the heart of your land as soon as the planning is complete.\"\n\nBut it also makes a vague reference to a possible truce with the United States.\n\nIt remains unclear when the tape was made, but it does confirm that the al-Qaeda leader is still alive.\n\nIn the tape, bin Laden refers to attacks in Europe, presumably the commuter-train bombings of 2004 in Madrid and last summer's transit bombings in London.\n\nAs translated from Arabic by CNN, the voice says: \"I would also like to say that the war against America and its allies will not be confined to Iraq. Iraq has become a magnet for attracting and training talented fighters.\n\n\"Our mujahadeen [holy warriors] were able to overcome all security measures in European countries, and you saw their operation in major European capitals,\" the voice adds.\n\n'Only a matter of time'\n\n\"As for similar operations taking place in America, it's only a matter of time.

There is no shame in this solution because it prevents wasting of billions of dollars ... to merchants of war.\"\n\nThe conditions for such a truce were not made clear.\n\nLast Friday's U.S. air strike in Pakistan, possibly involving missiles fired from remotely piloted aircraft, is thought to have been aimed at bin Laden's second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahiri.\n\nThe attack levelled a residential compound, killing as many as 18 civilians, including women and children, and two men described as senior members of bin Laden's al-Qaeda organization. Al-Zawahiri is believed to have escaped.\n\nOn its website, Al-Jazeera posted extensive excerpts from the tape, including these:\n\n\"This message is about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and how to end those wars.\n\nWars 'definitely going our way'\n\n\"It was not my intention to talk to you about this, because those wars are definitely going our way.\n\n\"But what triggered my desire to talk to you is the continuous deliberate misinformation given by your President [George W.] Bush, when it comes to polls made in your home country which reveal that the majority of your people are willing to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq.\n\nOther excerpts apparently aimed at Americans:\n\n\"If your desire for peace, stability and reconciliation was true, here we have given you the answer to your call.\"\n\n\"I would like to tell you that everything is going to our advantage and the number of your dead is increasing, according to Pentagon figures.\"\n\n\"The new operations of al-Qaeda has not happened not because we could not penetrate the security measures.

Salim Hamdan was convicted on Wednesday of supporting terrorism, but acquitted of conspiracy to murder. Prosecutors had demanded a sentence of not less than 30 years. On time served Hamdan could be released in five months but the Pentagon has said he will still be retained as an \"enemy combatant\". The US has always argued it can detain such people indefinitely, as long as its so-called war on terror continues. The Pentagon said Hamdan would serve his sentence and then be eligible for review. Regret The BBC's Kim Ghattas at the trial says the sentence is a dramatic snub to the Bush administration and came after just one-and-a-half hours of deliberation. The jury of six US military officers, not the judge, imposed the sentence under the tribunal rules. \"It is my duty as president [of the jury] to inform you that this military commission sentences you to be confined for 66 months,\" a juror told Hamdan. HAMDAN CHARGES Conspiracy: Not guilty of two counts of conspiring with al-Qaeda to attack civilians, destroy property and commit murder Providing support for terrorism: Guilty on five counts, including being the driver and bodyguard for Osama Bin Laden, a man he knew to be the leader of a terrorist group. Not guilty on three other counts\n\nAll sides claim victory Profile: Salim Hamdan Timeline: Al-Qaeda Our correspondent says Hamdan looked nervous as he walked in for sentencing but after hearing it, he told jurors: \"I would like to apologise one more time to all the members and I would like to thank you for what you have done for me.\" The judge, Navy Capt Keith Allred, told Hamdan: \"I hope the day comes when you return to your wife and your daughters and your country.\" Hamdan, who is aged about 40, smiled as he left court and said thank you to those in the room. After the sentencing, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said: \"He will serve out the rest of his sentence. At that time he will still be considered an enemy combatant. \"But he will be eligible for review by an Administrative Review Board.\" The boards decide annually on the threat posed by detainees and the possibility of their transfer or release. The White House had earlier said the trial was \"fair\". The defence is still likely to go ahead with the appeal it announced on Wednesday. Rights groups have condemned the tribunal system. Amnesty International said it was \"fundamentally flawed\" and should be abandoned. 'Worked for wages' In his earlier plea for leniency to the jury, Hamdan said in a prepared statement: \"It's true there are work opportunities in Yemen, but not at the level I needed after I got married and not to the level of ambitions that I had in my future.\" He said he regretted the loss of \"innocent lives\". Hamdan had admitted working for Bin Laden in Afghanistan from 1997 to 2001 for $200 (\u00a399) a month, but said he worked for wages, not to wage war on the US. About 270 suspects remain in detention in Guantanamo Bay.

The process had experienced legal, procedural and diplomatic delays.\n\nDeputy defense counsel Michael Berrigan called the trial a \"travesty\" but said the defense team \"is not at all unhappy with the results.\"\n\nBen Wizner, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who attended the trial as one of several human rights observers, ridiculed the administration for inaugurating the military system on \"a marginal figure.\"", "image": "", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/08/06/ST2008080601313.html"}, {"published": 1217980800.0, "title": "Bin Laden's driver convicted at Guantanamo", "body": "GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE, Cuba A military jury on Wednesday convicted Osama bin Laden's driver of supporting terrorism but acquitted him on more serious charges of conspiring with al Qaeda to wage murderous attacks, in the first U.S. war crimes trial since World War Two.\n\nThe trial of Yemeni captive Salim Hamdan at the remote U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba was the first full test of the controversial military tribunal authorized by the Bush administration to try foreign captives on terrorism charges outside the regular U.S. court system.\n\nSupporters of the trial by military commission, including the White House, said it had been vindicated by the split verdict. Human rights and civil liberties groups, and military defense lawyers, condemned the process.\n\nAs the subsequent sentencing hearing began, the judge called Hamdan \"a small player\" and refused to let the government call an FBI agent to testify about retrieving bodies from the World Trade Center after the September 11 attacks.\n\nThe judge, Navy Capt. Keith Allred, said the testimony was irrelevant since Hamdan had been cleared of conspiring with al Qaeda to carry out any attacks.\n\nWhile Hamdan was convicted on five counts of providing material support for terrorism, the judge said the charges duplicated each other and ordered that he be sentenced only for one count, which he summarized as \"driving Mr. bin Laden around Afghanistan.\"\n\nCHICKEN SELLER\n\nDefense lawyers said the partial acquittal affirmed their faith in the military officers on the jury but did nothing to remedy fundamental flaws in a system designed to convict on all counts.\n\nThe chief Guantanamo prosecutor, Army. Col. Lawrence Morris, said the verdict showed Hamdan was an al Qaeda warrior whose role went far beyond simply being a driver and should not be equated with \"somebody who sold a chicken to a terrorist.\"\n\nHamdan, who was captured in Afghanistan in 2001 after the U.S. invasion that followed the September 11 attacks, wore a white turban and long white robe topped with a tan blazer as he stood tensely in the courtroom and listened through headphones to the English-Arabic interpreter who relayed the verdict. He raised his hands and wept quietly into them when he heard \"guilty.\"\n\nHis case will be reviewed by the Pentagon appointee overseeing the tribunals and then by a special military appeals court. Hamdan could then appeal to the U.S. federal appeals court in Washington and finally to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nMORE TRIALS\n\nIn Washington, White House spokesman Tony Fratto said Hamdan received a fair trial and the military tribunal had been shown to work. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the military would move forward to try 20 other Guantanamo detainees facing war crimes charges, including five who could be executed if convicted of plotting the September 11 attacks.\n\nRepublican presidential hopeful John McCain welcomed the verdict and said the process of bringing terrorists to justice had been too long delayed. Democratic candidate Barack Obama said the long delay showed how flawed the U.S. government's legal approach was.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union called the tribunal a betrayal of American values from start to finish and \"a monumental debacle of American justice.\"\n\nThe jury heard two weeks of testimony, including that of 10 federal agents who interrogated Hamdan without warning him that his confessions would be used against him in a criminal trial.\n\nIt was the Bush administration's third attempt to try Hamdan, who won a Supreme Court victory that scrapped the first version of the Guantanamo court system in 2006. The charges were twice dropped and refiled.\n\nThe charges Hamdan was cleared of -- two counts of conspiring with al Qaeda to attack civilians, destroy property, and commit murder in violation of the laws of war -- were the only charges against him in the first prosecution attempt.\n\n\"The travesty of this verdict now is that had the case gone to trial in 2004 he would have been acquitted of all the charges,\" said Deputy Chief Defense Counsel Michael Berrigan.\n\nHamdan was convicted of providing personal services in support of terrorism, specifically driving, guarding and ferrying weapons for a man he knew to be the leader of an international terrorist organization.\n\n\"The Pentagon must be very proud of itself today,\" said John Wesley Hall, head of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. \"It convicted a truck driver of being guilty of driving a truck.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Randall Mikkelsen in Washington; Editing by Tom Brown)", "image":

The Department of Justice has made clear that none of the information at stake was classified. Most of what the alleged spies were after seems almost anodyne. While the incident does not look good for the Russians, the initial US reaction has been sanguine. Russian spy stories may be a throwback to the Cold War and sound alarming but they probably don't surprise anyone in Washington, especially not in the government.

Some of the agents lived as married couples and had children who have grown up as Americans unaware that their parents are Russian.\n\nThe FBI alleges that the accused spies were able to get close to a scientist working with \"bunker-buster\" nuclear bombs and a New York financier with powerful political ties. But the intercepts do not suggest they were successful at uncovering valuable information and some of the exchanges with Moscow appear almost laughable in their simplicity, including advice to one agent to \"build up little by little relations\" with the financier.\n\nThe FBI said that the deep cover agents were called \"Illegals\" by Moscow. An intercepted message from the SVR to two of the alleged spies outlined their mission.\n\n\"You were sent to USA for long-term service trip. Your education, your bank accounts, car, house, etc \u2013 all these serve one goal: fulfill your main mission, ie to search and develop ties in policymaking circles in US and send intels (intelligence reports) to C (Centre),\" an intercepted message said according to the indictment.\n\nThe FBI described the \"Illegals\" as being paired in Russia \"so that they can live together and work together in a host country, under the guise of a married couple. Illegals who are placed together and cohabit in the country to which they are assigned will often have children together\".\n\nThe arrests were made in Arlington, Virginia \u2013 close to the Pentagon and CIA headquarters \u2013 and in New York, Boston and New Jersey. One of the detained couples lives on the west coast, in Seattle. The justice department said one other alleged spy, who is accused of delivering payments to members of the ring, is still being sought.\n\nAccording to the indictments, members of the spy ring reported back to Moscow in 2004 that they were able to get close to an American whom the Russian agents described as involved in \"strategic planning related to nuclear weapon development\" and \"had conversations with him about research programs on small yield high penetration nuclear warheads recently authorised by US Congress (nuclear 'bunker-buster' warheads)\".\n\nAnother alleged spy, named as Cynthia Murphy, built a relationship with a man described as a prominent New York-based financier active in politics. Moscow responded that he was a very interesting target because he might be able to provide information about foreign policy and discussions among the president's closest aides.\n\nThe SVR also urged its agents to collect information on the US positions on arms talks, Iran's nuclear programme and Afghanistan in advance of Barack Obama's visit to Russia last year. Moscow also sought information about personnel turnover at the top of the CIA and the 2008 presidential election.\n\nThe indictment says the alleged spies used a number of methods to communicate with the SVR including unique wireless networks to transfer encrypted data. One of the wireless networks was run from a van in New York that on one occasion parked outside a coffee shop where one of the accused , named as Anna Chapman, was sitting. The FBI said it observed as she established a connection with the wireless link in the van and transmitted data. A few weeks later she did the same from a bookshop.\n\nThe FBI said it also observed a car with diplomatic plates registered to the Russian government park outside a Washington DC restaurant where another alleged spy who went by the name Mikhail Semenko, who is still being sought by the authorities, used a computer to establish a connection with a wireless signal from the car.\n\nOther information was passed by posting pictures on the internet that had text buried in them as well as long established techniques such as drops and \"brush pasts\" in local parks.\n\nRelations between the alleged spies and their handlers were not always cordial as the \"illegals\" took to the American way of life.\n\nIn one intercepted message, Richard and Cynthia Murphy, who arrived in the US in the mid-1990s, decided to buy a house in New Jersey. That did not go down well at Moscow centre.\n\n\"We are under the impression that C. views our ownership of the house as a deviation from the original purpose of our mission here,\" they said in an intercepted message. \"We'd like to assure you that we do remember what it is.

The \"Russian agent\" will say: \"Excuse me, but haven't we met in California last summer?\" Chapman was to reply: \"No, I think it was the Hamptons (right).\" Chapman then asks the undercover FBI agent: \"You're positive no one is watching?\" She was assured that no one was.\n\nThe FBI agent assured Chapman she was well regarded in Russia. \"Your colleagues back in Moscow, they know you are doing a good job and they will tell you this when they see you.

In both, excess heat in the reactor caused fuel to melt - and in the first, wider melting of the core. The question is whether the same thing has happened in Fukushima. It appears that the reactor was shut down well before any melting occurred, which should reduce considerably the risk of radioactive materials entering the environment. However, the detection of caesium isotopes outside the power station buildings could imply that the core has been exposed to the air. Although Japan has a long and largely successful nuclear power programme, officials have been less than honest about some incidents in the past, meaning that official reassurances are unlikely to convince everyone this time round. Japan's nuclear picture unclear\n\nThe government has urged residents to remain calm and is preparing to distribute iodine to anyone affected.\n\nTests showed at least three patients evacuated from a hospital near the plant had been exposed to radiation, public broadcaster NHK quoted local government officials as saying.

He added that sea water was being pumped into the site to lower temperatures.\n\nBefore the explosion, Japan's nuclear agency had said that radioactive caesium and iodine had been detected near the number one reactor. The agency said this could indicate that containers of uranium fuel inside the reactor may have begun melting.\n\nAir and steam, with some level of radioactivity, was earlier released from several of the reactors at both plants in an effort to relieve the huge amount of pressure building up inside.\n\nScenes of devastation\n\nThe tsunami that followed the 8.9-magnitude earthquake wreaked havoc along a huge stretch of on Japan's north-east coast, sweeping far inland and devastating a number of towns and villages.\n\nThe BBC's Damian Grammaticas in the coastal city of Sendai, in Miyagi prefecture, says the scenes of devastation there are astonishing - giant shipping containers have been swept inland and smashed against buildings, and fires are still burning close to the harbour.\n\nThe scale of the devastation is immense\n\nPolice said between 200 and 300 bodies were found in just one ward of the city.\n\nThe town of Rikuzentakada, Iwate, was reported as largely destroyed and almost completely submerged.

Are you there? Send your video, pictures to iReport.\n\nTokyo (CNN) -- While saying there are no indications yet of dangerously high radiation levels in the atmosphere, a Japanese government official said Sunday that there is a \"possibility of a meltdown\" at two of the country's nuclear reactors.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters that officials still do not know if there have been meltdowns in the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi's nuclear facility in northeast Japan. But as they attempt to cool down radioactive material and release pressure inside the reactors, he said authorities were working under the presumption that such meltdowns have taken place.\n\n\"We do believe that there is a possibility that meltdown has occurred. It is inside the reactor. We can't see. However, we are assuming that a meltdown has occurred,\" he said of the No. 1 reactor. \"And with reactor No. 3, we are also assuming that the possibility of a meltdown as we carry out measures.\"\n\nA meltdown is a catastrophic failure of the reactor core, with a potential for widespread radiation release.\n\nEdano's comments confirmed an earlier report from an official with Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, who had told CNN, \"we see the possibility of a meltdown.\"\n\nThough Toshihiro Bannai, director of the agency's international affairs office, said engineers have been unable to get close enough to the core to know what's going on, he based his conclusion on the fact that they measured radioactive isotopes in the air Saturday night.\n\n\"What we have seen is only the slight indication from a monitoring post of cesium and iodine,\" he said.\n\nBut Bannai added that he didn't believe a disaster was looming.\n\n\"We actually have very good confidence that we will resolve this,\" he said.\n\nEdano, too, raised few alarms during his press conference Sunday. He based his optimism in large part on measurements of radiation outside the nuclear plant, conceding fluctuations may occur while stating that levels have generally decreased.\n\n\"We are continuing to monitor the radiation, but it is (under) control,\" he said.\n\nEdano said that nine people have tested positive for high radiation levels on their skin and clothing, with doctors now trying to determine if they were impacted internally. Medical care, including radiation screening, will be offered to those who are being evacuated from the nuclear zone, the secretary added.\n\nThe Japanese government was preparing to distribute iodine tablets to residents, the IAEA said. Iodine is commonly recommended to block the uptake by the thyroid gland of radioactive iodine.\n\nThe problems at the Daiichi plant began Friday, when the 8.9-magnitude quake struck off the eastern shore of Miyagi Prefecture. The quake forced the automatic shutdown of the plant's nuclear reactors and knocked out the main cooling system, according to the country's nuclear agency.\n\nA tsunami resulting from the quake then washed over the site, knocking out backup generators that pumped water into the reactor containment unit to keep the nuclear fuel cool.\n\nEdano said that there have not been any leaks of radioactive material at either of the affected plants. Authorities deliberately have let out radioactive steam in order to alleviate growing pressure inside both of the affected reactors.\n\nPressure had been mounting inside the reactors as steam built up inside, because water meant to cool the fuel rods was boiling.\n\nAs of Sunday morning, winds in northeast Japan were blowing out to sea at 5-15 mph, said CNN Meteorologist Taylor Ward. But they were expected to reverse direction by Monday night, he said. The Daiichi plant is located about 160 miles (260 kilometers) north of Tokyo.\n\nPlant officials are also injecting sea water and boron into the plant in an effort to cool its nuclear fuel and stop any reactions.\n\nBoron, a chemical element, was being added to the water \"to sort of stymie other potential nuclear reactions,\" according to Robert Alvarez, senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies and a former senior policy adviser to the U.S. secretary of energy. He described the plan to use salt water as \"an act of desparation\" by Japanese authorities, who seemed unable to deliver fresh water or plain water to cool the reactor and stabilize it.\n\nEarlier, Edano had pointed out another potential challenge -- saying, without elaboration, that \"some of the readings in the measurement equipment were not accurate.\"\n\nThe detection of a cesium isotope -- as noted by Bannai -- indicates that the reactors' nuclear fuel cladding has failed, said Ken Bergeron, a physicist and former scientist at Sandia National Laboratories.\n\n\"Now we have to hope that the containment building will succeed in preventing major amounts of radioactivity\" from escaping, he said. Fukushima Daiichi facility has such a building -- something that Chernobyl, the Soviet nuclear plant that famously melted down in 1986, did not have.\n\nCesium 137 can remain dangerous for 600 years and is associated with a number of cancers, said Dr. Ira Helfand, a member of the board of Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n\nSome experts said the flow of information from the agency has not been fast enough.\n\nBut IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano defended the Japanese response. \"I know the Japanese authorities are working their hardest to gather the necessary details and ensure safety under difficult and constantly evolving circumstances,\" he said in a statement.\n\nIf the effort to cool the nuclear fuel inside the reactor fails completely -- a scenario experts who have spoken to CNN say is unlikely -- the resulting release of radiation could cause enormous damage to the plant or release radiation into the atmosphere or water. That could lead to widespread cancer and other health problems, experts say.\n\nAuthorities have downplayerd such a scenario, insisting the situation appears under control and that radiation levels in the air are dangerous. Still, as what they described as \"a precuation,\" more than 200,000 people who live within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the plant have been ordered to leave the area. A similar evacuation order has been issued for those with 10 kilometers of the Fukashima Daini nuclear facility, a separate plant also in Fukashima prefecture.\n\nEven absent this, nuclear materials expert Joseph Cirincione -- president of the U.S.-based Ploughshares Fund, a firm involved in security and peace funding -- ranks this scenario third, behind Chernobyl and the 1979 partial meltdown of a reactor core at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, among history's worst nuclear power crises.\n\nJapan is heavily dependent on nuclear power, with 54 plants and another eight slated for construction, said Aileen Mioko Smith of Green Action, an environmental group. All are located in \"very seismic\" areas, she said.\n\nWhile experts acknowledged that Japan's nuclear program is very well respected, physicist Ken Bergeron saying that now \"we're in uncharted territory.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is that we just don't know what's going to happen in the next couple of days and, frankly, neither do the people who run the system,\" added Dr. Ira Helfand, a member of the board of Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n\nWhat we do know, he added, is that Japan's nuclear facilities are \"way out of whack.\"\n\nCNN's Tom Watkins and Greg Botelho contributed to this story.", "image": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/12/japan.nuclear/t1larg.radioactive.jpg", "url": "http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/12/japan.nuclear/"}]}, {"title": "South Korean police clamp down on protests against US beef", "articles": [{"published": 1214784000.0, "title": "S Korean police arrest over 120 people during weekend protests against U.S. beef", "body": "SEOUL, June 30 (Xinhua) -- In the first major clampdown on protesters after a U.S. beef import deal took effect, Seoul police arrested at least 125 people during mass demonstrations that continued into early Monday.\n\nSouth Korean news agency reported that about 1,700 people gathered at Jongno street in central Seoul at 9 p.m. Sunday and hundreds of them stayed into the early morning hours, chanting slogans such as \"Renegotiate the beef deal\" and \"Lee Myung-bak out.\"\n\nThe protesters rallied in several groups, unable to enter their usual protest venue at Seoul City Hall plaza, which was sealed off by police buses.\n\nPolice took about 70 people into custody early Monday for illegally occupying roads.

As many as 80,000 people have staged daily demonstrations for the past two months to highlight the possibility of mad cow disease from imported U.S. beef.\n\nLee was forced to publicly apologize for his handling of the negotiations and fired all but one of his top aides.\n\nSouth Korea, once the third-largest importer of American beef, stopped accepting shipments in 2003 when the U.S. discovered its first mad cow case. Some beef was imported in 2006 and the ban was reinstated in October last year.\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea agreed June 21 that South Korea will import beef only from animals younger than 30 months, which are thought to be at lower risk for mad cow disease. The U.S. agreed to verify the age of its exports.\n\n`Violent Protests'\n\n``The candle-lit vigils, which were initially peaceful, have mutated into violent protests organized by a small faction,'' Justice Minister Kim Kyung Han said late yesterday in Seoul. ``Illegal and violent protesters kill the everyday economy and the damages are incurred by the people who stoically go about their businesses.''\n\nThe government will take ``stern countermeasures such as using water laced with tear gas, in order to prevent accidents caused by physical clashes,'' Kim said. The government will also hunt people or factions that encourage violence and will seek compensation from those who destroy public property, including police buses, he said.\n\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency today raided the offices of AntiMadCow, an umbrella group of South Korean consumer groups, food safety advocates and student activists, located in the building of the People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, a leading civil rights group.\n\n``The police have raided our offices and detained one of our officials,'' AntiMadCow said on its Web site. A spokesman for the Police Agency who declined to be identified confirmed the raid. He didn't give any details.\n\nMad cow disease is a brain-wasting livestock illness that scientists say is spread in cattle by tainted animal feed. Eating contaminated meat from infected animals can cause a fatal human variant that has been blamed for the deaths of 151 people in the U.K., where it was first reported in the 1980s.\n\nFor related stories: South Korean beef: {TNI SKOREA BEEF BN <GO>} Bloomberg's top commodities news: {CTOP <GO>}\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Heejin Koo in Seoul at hjkoo@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Paul Tighe at ptighe@bloomberg.net; Bill Austin in Tokyo at billaustin@bloomberg.net", "image": "http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/data?pid=avimage&iid=isa8t9bY3uUk", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=aH7RtgjuWKLk&refer=asia"}, {"published": 1214784000.0, "title": "Beef Protest Turns Violent in South Korea", "body": "SEOUL, South Korea \u0097 The government of President Lee Myung-bak sealed off major rallying points in central Seoul on Sunday after hundreds of citizens and police officers were injured during a protest against United States beef imports.\n\nPolice buses cordoned off plazas and intersections where large crowds have gathered almost daily since early May to demand that the government renegotiate the deal. Police officers blocked subway entrances and alleys leading to those rallying points.\n\nStill, protesters broke into several groups of hundreds and marched Sunday evening, engaging in sporadic shoving matches with the police.\n\nJustice Minister Kim Kyung-han said in a statement on Sunday, \u201cWe will chase those who instigate violent protests and those who use violence to the end and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim warned that the police would use liquid tear gas, which they have refrained from using in the past decade. They commonly used liquid tear gas against antigovernment demonstrators during the military dictatorships of the 1970s and \u201980s and against labor activists of the 1990s.\n\nThe Korean Metal Workers\u2019 Union, which represents workers at 240 companies, including the country\u2019s four major automakers, said 76 percent of its voting members had agreed to a two-hour work stoppage on Wednesday to demand a new beef deal and better working conditions.\n\nThe Catholic Priests\u2019 Association for Justice, an influential religious group known for its struggle against the dictatorships, said it would lead an outdoor Mass on Monday to lend its moral support to the protesters.\n\nA protest that began Saturday evening and continued until Sunday morning attracted more than 18,000 people, the largest crowd since a rally on June 10 brought together at least 100,000 people.\n\nPolice officials reported that 112 officers had been injured and 35 police vehicles had been damaged. About 50 protesters were detained on charges of assaulting police officers, they said.\n\nOrganizers of the protest said that 300 to 400 people had been hurt \u201cbecause of police brutality.\u201d\n\nIn April, South Korea agreed to lift the ban on American beef, first imposed in 2003 after a case of mad cow disease was detected in the United States.

Mr. Jones drew worldwide criticism last year for threatening to burn Qurans on the anniversary of 9/11.\n\nThe UN is still assessing the scope of damage and determining the exact death toll at its offices in Mazir-e-Sharif, a typically quiet city in northern Afghanistan.\n\nRecommended: Could you pass a US citizenship test?\n\nWhile the outburst of civilian violence aimed at the UN is rare, this attack seems to show that anger over the foreign presence in Afghanistan is coming to the surface.\n\n\u201cIn general you can easily rally people around issues such as insulting the Koran and insulting the prophet,\" says Martine van Bijlert, codirector of the Afghanistan Analysts Network. \"But other than that I think there is also an increasing tension and annoyance with the international presence and so a demonstration like that does get mixed up with more general suspicions about the intentions of the internationals.\u201d\n\nToday's violence came after two or three hours of protests over the Florida Quran burning, which was broadcast online. Demonstrators started throwing stones at the UN compound then attempted to climb its walls and attacked guards. In addition to as many as 20 UN workers being killed, at least four protestors died. The UN\u2019s chief of mission in the city was injured but survived the attack.\n\nAfghanistan saw several protests when Mr. Jones previously planned to burn the Koran on the anniversary of 9/11 last year. The controversial pastor of Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Fla., decided not to go through with it at the time, largely due to a phone call from top Afghanistan commander US Gen. David Petraeus, who warned that the defamation of the Quran would likely cost the lives of US service men and women Afghanistan.\n\nJones decided to go through with the burning on March 20 after serving as judge in a \u201ctrial\u201d of the Muslim holy book. He found it \u201cguilty\u201d of \u201ctraining and promoting terrorist activities ... death, rape, torture of people worldwide\u201d and crimes against women and minorities.\n\nA smaller demonstration with about 100 protestors also took place in front of the US Embassy in Kabul. Demonstrators called for US forces to leave Afghanistan. There were no reports of violence or injury.\n\nFriday's attack may cause the UN to reconsider the extent of its presence here. After the 2009 attack against UN guesthouses in Kabul, the UN pulled 200 workers from Afghanistan and withdrew an additional 400 from field postings to safer urban locations.\n\nLess than two weeks ago, Afghan President Hamid Karzai announced that Mazir-e-Sharif would be among the first seven areas to be transitioned to the control of Afghan security forces. The UN deaths could certainly generate high-level discussions about the transition scheduled for mid-July.\n\n\u201cIf anything what this attack demonstrates is that it will be a long time before transition is possible,\u201d says Candace Rondeaux, the International Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst for Afghanistan. \u201cIf you can\u2019t deal with a public demonstration and control it then how can you deal with a sophisticated insurgency that\u2019s armed to the teeth?\u201d", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csmarchives/2011/04/0401-Afghanistan-UN-workers-killed.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2011/0401/UN-staff-killed-by-Afghan-mob-enraged-over-Florida-Quran-burning"}, {"published": 1301616000.0, "title": "Worst attack on U.N. in Afghanistan kills at least 7", "body": "MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan Afghans protesting the burning of a Koran by an obscure U.S. pastor over-ran a U.N. compound on Friday and killed at least seven international staff in the deadliest-ever attack on the United Nations in Afghanistan.\n\nThousands of demonstrators flooded into the streets after Friday prayers and headed for the U.N. mission in usually peaceful Mazar-i-Sharif, a city considered safe enough to be in the vanguard of a crucial security transition.\n\nThe governor of Balkh province said insurgents had used the march as cover to attack the compound, in a battle that raged for hours and raised serious questions about plans to make the city a pilot for security transfer to national forces.\n\nThe confirmed dead were three international U.N. staff and four international Gurkha guards.\n\nIn New York, U.N. peacekeeping chief Alain Le Roy told reporters after briefing members of the Security Council who convened an emergency session to discuss the attack, that some of the protesters seemed to be more than demonstrators.\n\n\"Some of them were clearly armed,\" Le Roy said, adding that they appeared to have targeted the foreigners at the compound. \"We are not sure at all that the U.N. was the target.\"\n\n\"Maybe they wanted to find an international target and the U.N. was the one in Mazar-i-Sharif,\" Le Roy said, adding that an investigation of the incident was in progress.\n\nThe attackers overwhelmed security guards, burned parts of the compound and climbed up blast walls to topple a guard tower. Five protesters were also killed and about 20 wounded, some after trying to take weapons off U.N. security guards.\n\n\"The insurgents have taken advantage of the situation to attack the U.N. compound,\" said Governor Ata Mohammad Noor.\n\nHe told a news conference that many in the crowd of protesters had been carrying guns. Some 27 people have already been detained over the attack, he added.\n\nLe Roy said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's chief-of-staff, Vijay Nambiar, and head of U.N. security Gregory Starr were heading to Kabul on Friday night.

Mazar mobs were active in the 1990s, repeatedly ransacking UN offices ... but so far as I remember, they never actually killed anyone,\" a former U.N. employee in Afghanistan told Reuters.\n\nThe worst previous attack was an insurgent assault on a Kabul guest house where U.N. staff were staying in October 2009. Five employees were killed and nine others wounded.\n\nThe two largest recent attacks on U.N. compounds in other countries are a 2007 bomb in Algiers that killed 17 U.N. staff, and a 2003 attack on the Baghdad hotel that was the U.N. headquarters there, which killed at least 22 people.\n\nChristian preacher Terry Jones, who after international condemnation canceled a plan last year to burn copies of the Koran, supervised the burning of the book in front of about 50 people at a church in Florida on March 20, according to his website.\n\nHe told the British Broadcasting Corporation he did not feel guilty over the deaths in Mazar. \"We are not responsible for their actions,\" Jones said, when asked about the attack.\n\nThousands of demonstrators marched through western Herat city and about 200 in Kabul to protest the same incident, but there was no violence at either demonstration.\n\nLong-standing anger over civilian casualties has been heightened by the Koran burning and the recent publication of gruesome photographs of the body of an unarmed Afghan teenager killed by U.S. soldiers.\n\n\"COWARDLY\" ATTACK\n\nThe Afghan police and army, whom the United Nations rely on for its first line of defense, were apparently unable to control the crowd. The NATO-led coalition said German troops answered a request for help, but it was not clear when the call was made or answered.\n\nU.N. officials in New York said earlier that as many as 20 U.N. staff may have been killed. They said later that figure had included people who turned out to be Afghan demonstrators.\n\nAn Afghan police spokesman said two of the U.N. dead were beheaded. Le Roy said no one was beheaded, although one victim's throat was cut.\n\nThe head of the mission in the city, a Russian, was injured but was now in the hospital, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. Russia called on the Afghan government and international forces to \"take all necessary measures\" to protect U.N. workers.\n\nRomania's Foreign Ministry said preliminary information suggested a Romanian citizen was among the dead, the Norwegian U.N. mission confirmed a Norwegian was one of the dead and Sweden confirmed a Swedish man was also killed.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama, Afghan counterpart Hamid Karzai and NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen joined condemnation of the attack.\n\n(Additional reporting by Hamid Shalizi in Kabul, Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva, Amie Ferris-Rotman in Moscow and Louis Charbonneau in New York, Writing by Emma Graham-Harrison; Editing by Alex Richardson and Peter Cooney)", "image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20110401&t=2&i=376131650&w=1200&fh=&fw=&ll=&pl=&r=2011-04-01T194024Z_01_BTRE7301IND00_RTROPTP_0_AFGHANISTAN", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/01/us-afghanistan-idUSTRE7306JP20110401?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews"}, {"published": 1301616000.0, "title": "Seven killed in worst-ever attack on UN workers in Afghanistan", "body": "The victims of the worst-ever attack on UN personnel in Afghanistan included five guards from Nepal, and civilian staff from Norway, Sweden and Romania.

Even though Mr Jones called off his planned action in the face of global outrage, five people were killed in protests targeting Nato facilities in Afghanistan. Pastor Jones told Sky News in the wake of the attack that the US \"must take action\".\n\nFollowing the Koran burning, Maulvi Qayamuddin Kashaf, had called on American authorities to prosecute Mr Sapp as a war criminal. Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's President, had also described the Koran burning as a \"crime against religion,\" and called on the US and UN to take action.\n\nIt is unclear how the demonstration in Mazar-e-Sharif turned violent, but Mr Noor said 20 \"insurgents\" involved in the killings had been arrested, suggesting they may have infiltrated the crowd.

When it is time to ask for help, they don't,\" said Figueroa, a psychiatrist who was brought to the mine by the government in an effort to help analyse the miners' mental health. The extraordinary predicament of the men trapped underground has touched the hearts of all Chileans, producing an unprecedented sense of national solidarity. Each passing chapter of the miners' saga has served to unite the nation.\n\nCarolina Lobos, daughter of trapped miner and former football star Franklin Lobos, told reporters: \"We have all changed because of this. Before it was not very common for people in my family to say 'I love you' or 'I miss you'. Now I call my mum every night, I tell her how much I love her and send kisses. Now we are all valuing much more the people we have by our sides.\"\n\nNow, though, the hard work begins. The hi-tech rig expected to drill 700m down to the trapped men was scheduled to begin operations today and take a full 90 days to reach them. The miners have been assured they will be out before Christmas.\n\nWith experts ranging from Nasa doctors to submarine commanders, a team of 300 specialists co-ordinated by the Chilean government has spent the past week scrambling to design a programme of medicine, entertainment and exercise aimed at keeping the 33 men alive and stable for the duration of the rescue operation. Ma\u00f1alich, one of the co-ordinators, admits he is often in virgin territory. \"To my knowledge, this is a singular experience in human history.\"\n\nWith Nasa urging the use of entertainment, the Chilean government is planning to deliver movies and videos of football matches to the miners, who will also be given a home theatre system.\n\nA video conference facility is near completion in which the family members can enter a room above ground and have daily video chats with their loved ones deep beneath the rock.\n\nA host of questions have yet to be answered. Should the men be allowed to smoke in their underground home? Nicotine gum has been delivered to the miners, although Ma\u00f1alich has not ruled out sending down cigarettes. Bringing artificial light to the darkened tunnels is also a priority for health officials, as controlled lighting is also considered a key factor in maintaining the men's sanity by providing a semblance of day and night.\n\nGiven the unprecedented challenges and stress facing the miners and their families, many have felt their religious faith strengthened.\n\nThroughout Camp Hope, the base camp established by the miners' relatives, figures of the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ and St Expedito (St Expeditus) are on display. St Expedito is popular in Chile as a figure whose help is sought to speed up bureaucracy and provide urgent solutions.\n\nEarlier last week, an evangelical preacher arrived at Camp Hope with a series of miniature bibles that he had custom-manufactured to fit the dimensions of the small hole connecting to the trapped miners.\n\nDespite the numerous challenges, the men have thus far survived as a coherent and functioning group. \"What I see here is a group of people who never lost hope, they were always certain that they were going to be rescued... Because they could hear the [rescue] machines. They knew the rescue mission was looking for them and that has helped them maintain \u2013 up until now \u2013 an optimum psychological state,\" said Jaime Carvallo, the lead government psychologist working with the miners' families. \"The main problem facing the miners and their families is the uncertainty.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a nation watches and does what it can to help. In this lost corner of the Atacama desert, one of the world's driest spots, it is as if Chile had suddenly sprouted flags, tents and crude shrines to the 33 men. A spirit of solidarity has descended upon this rocky no-man's land. Without a formal petition for aid or a website, volunteers throughout Chile arrive to bring support \u2013 moral, physical and monetary \u2013 to the families of the trapped miners.\n\n\"The country has shown a unity regardless of religion or social class. You see people arriving here just to volunteer, they have no relation at all to these families,\" said Ivan Viveros Aranas, a Chilean policeman working at Camp Hope.\n\nLiving in tents and cars, the relatives of the miners are settled in for what is expected to be another 12 weeks of rescue efforts. Every few hours, a distant honking announces the arrival of another load of free supplies.\n\n\"I get emotional to see how the whole nation is supporting our families. When they found the miners [alive] the whole country celebrated like it was their own family,\" said Lobos. \"They don't even know us and they call the home, they tell me they are praying for me. People help with food, with money. I get calls where people call me up saying they are sending a truckload of food. Schools send me bags of letters.\"\n\nFlamboyant Chilean mining executive Leonardo Farkas arrived in his Hummer and announced he had brought a cheque for 5,000,000 Chilean pesos [\u00a37,000] to each family. A second businessman has matched the donation, while Farkas pressed for all Chilean businessmen to chip in until the men had been given a million dollars each.\n\nA collective of local fishermen brought a truckload of fish, then grilled it for all to eat in a celebratory feast. Local fruit growers arrive with crates of orange. So much firewood has been donated it now sits in a pile 6m high, witness to the growing sense of unity and hope which has engulfed this nation.\n\nPresident Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era has taken a flamboyant front-row stance in the crisis, projecting a never-give-up attitude that resonates heavily with Chileans who often feel that the government ignores the immediate needs of the poor and working class.\n\nOne week ago, when President Pi\u00f1era made the now historic announcement that the 33 miners had been found alive, the entire nation erupted in an outpouring of patriotic fervour. Drivers honked their horns in a cacophony of celebration, while hundreds of joyous Chileans rushed to Plaza Italia, a central roundabout in Santiago often used to celebrate football victories.\n\nCars throughout Chile are now adorned with signs \"Fuerza Mineros\" [Miners, be strong], Chilean flags and the phrase \"Los 33\".\n\nAt every new development of the mining saga, Chileans are pulling together in a sense of national unity that has catapulted Pi\u00f1era to high rankings in opinion polls and levitated Lawrence Golborne, the formerly anonymous mining minister, to such fame that he is now jokingly referred to as \"Lawrence of Atacama\".\n\nLike a fantastically popular soap opera, the audience for this saga grows daily \u2013 a new language has entered the national consciousness as words like \"sonda\" and \"palomas\" became topics of spirited debate. Would the sonda \u2013 borehole \u2013 find the men? Will the palomas \u2013 small tubes used to send messages and food \u2013 be fast enough to keep the men nourished?\n\nIn one of the early conversations with the miners, a spontaneous singing broke out \u2013 all 33 miners, hearty and proud, unleashed a rendition of the national anthem that crackled and groaned from the depths of the mine. It was a chorus of strength which had half the nation in tears and guaranteed that, when Chile celebrates the national bicentennial on 18 September, it will have a new group of national heroes.", "image": "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2010/8/28/1283007635203/Chilean-miners-006.jpg", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/29/trapped-miners-chile-depression-fears"}, {"published": 1283040000.0, "title": "Chilean Miners Must Aid Own Rescue", "body": "SAN JOS\u00c9 MINE, Chile (AP) \u2014 The 33 trapped Chilean miners who have astonished the world with their discipline a half-mile underground will have to aid their own escape \u2014 clearing 3,000 to 4,000 tons of rock that will fall as the rescue hole is drilled, the engineer in charge of drilling said Sunday.\n\nAfter drilling three small holes in recent weeks to create lines of communication and deliver food and medicine, Chile\u2019s state-owned Codelco mining company plans to begin boring a rescue hole on Monday that will be wide enough to pull the men up through 2,300 feet of earth.\n\nThe rescue hole drilling will force rock to fall into the mine shaft area near the trapped men.\n\n\u201cThe miners are going to have to take out all that material as it falls,\u201d said Andres Sougarret, Codelco\u2019s head engineer on the operation.\n\nThe work will require about a half-dozen men working in shifts 24 hours a day.\n\nWhile it is not clear if the government is simply trying to underpromise, then overdeliver, there is widespread agreement that the drilling is unlikely to endanger the miners.", "image": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/world/americas/30chile.html?ref=chile"}, {"published": 1282867200.0, "title": "Trapped Chilean miners sing national anthem in footage from inside mine", "body": "The first video footage of the 33 Chilean miners who have been trapped underground for three weeks shows the men in good spirits, singing the national anthem and chanting, \"Long live Chile, and long live the miners.\"\n\nThe men shot the video with a camera sent down to them through a small shaft drilled to their emergency shelter in the San Jos\u00e9 mine.\n\nFive minutes of what is understood to be a 45-minute video were released late yesterday by the Chilean government.\n\nIn the grainy, night-vision footage, the men appear stripped to the waist and with thick beards.\n\nOne miner gives a guided tour of the small shelter where the men took refuge when a landslide trapped them inside the mine on 5 August.\n\nHe explains that he and his colleagues have enough room to stand and lie down, points out the \"little cup to brush our teeth\", and the place where they pray each day.\n\n\"We have everything organised,\" he says.\n\nThe few items they have are carefully laid out: a first aid cabinet, shelves holding unidentified bottles, mats in a corner for rest.\n\nAs the camera fixes on a table where dominoes have been laid out, the tour guide says that \"this is where we entertain ourselves, where we play cards\".\n\nHe added: \"We meet here every day. We plan, we have assemblies here every day so that all the decisions we make are based on the thoughts of all 33.\"\n\nMany of the miners appear in the video wearing their hard hats. As the camera pans to them, some flash peace signs, wave and smile. Others look groggy as if they have just woken up.\n\n\"Greetings to my family,\" says one unidentified man. \"Get us out of here soon, please.\"\n\nAt one point the footage shows a close-up of a thermometer reading 29.5C (85F).\n\nAccording to psychiatrists, one of the miners demonstrates the kind of practical optimism key to the miners' high morale.\n\n\"There are a large number of professionals who are going to help in the rescue efforts from down here,\" he says.\n\nTowards the end of the video, the men launch into a hearty rendition of the national anthem.\n\nThe camera was sent down through a borehole used for communications. Another small hole that snakes down to the men's shelter is used for lowering food, while a third provides ventilation.\n\nWhat the men may not know is that the mining company that hired them is doing nothing to help the rescue attempt. The San Esteban company says it cannot afford to pay their wages and may go bankrupt.\n\nSan Esteban is in such bad shape that it has neither the equipment nor the money to rescue the men. The escape tunnel, which will cost about \u00a31.1m, will instead be drilled by Chile's state-owned mining company.\n\nEarlier this week, San Esteban lawyers said that with the mine shut down the company was at risk of bankruptcy.\n\nSenator Baldo Prokurica, who is on the Senate mining committee, said he had been pushing Congress for years to increase the number of inspectors for the state regulatory agency, Sernageomin. It had only 18, he said, which made regulating the country's several hundred mines a daunting task.\n\n\"The government has abandoned [the regulator],\" Prokurica said in an interview with the Associated Press. \"If you look at the laws, they are good. We need to enforce the laws, not make more laws or increase fines.\"\n\nPresident Sebastian Pi\u00f1era has fired top regulators and created a commission to investigate the accident and the agency. Since the collapse, the agency has shut down at least 18 small mines for safety violations, a possible sign that lax safety measures were open secrets at many mines.\n\nYesterday, the first of many expected lawsuits against San Esteban and the government were filed, and a judge ordered the retention of \u00a31.2m of company money in anticipation of the suits.\n\nDespite advances in technology and increased emphasis on safety, at least publicly, mining remains a dangerous profession.\n\nSince 2000, an average of 34 people have died every year in mining accidents in Chile, with a high of 43 in 2008, according to a review of Sernageomin data.", "image": "http://static.guim.co.uk/icons/social/og/gu-logo-fallback.png", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/27/trapped-chilean-miners-video"}, {"published": 1282867200.0, "title": "Sweaty and unshaven, trapped Chilean miners give hope to families in video", "body": "Stripped to their waists and sweating in the heat, unshaven, scrawny and filthy but all, it seemed, optimistic and hearty: the first video footage of the 33 trapped Chilean miners gave hope today to their families waiting above ground.\n\nIn the haunting 45-minute video, released on Thursday night, the miners send messages of love against a backdrop of tunnels and caverns that have entombed them since the cave-in on 5 August.\n\nAt the entrance to the San Jos\u00e9 mine, where family members have set up camp, the atmosphere was jubilant. Ruth Contreras, whose son Carlos Bravo is one of the trapped men, said: \"He's skinny, bearded and it was painful to see him with his head hanging down, but I am so happy to see him alive.\"\n\nThe grainy video was shot by the men with a camera sent through a small relief shaft which reached their emergency shelter on Sunday. A second tube for enriched oxygen and a third for video conferences are nearly complete, meaning the families will soon be able to hold daily chats.\n\nIn the footage, the men \u2013 many still wearing their helmets \u2013 take turns to address the camera, some cracking jokes but all repeatedly thanking those involved in the rescue effort.\n\nMario Sepulvedra, the narrator, gives a guided tour of the area. He explains they have enough room to stand and lie down, points out the \"little cup to brush our teeth\", and the place where they pray. \"We have everything organised,\" he says.\n\nAs the camera fixes on a table where dominoes have been laid out, he says: \"This is where we entertain ourselves, where we play cards. We meet here every day. We plan, we have assemblies here every day so that all the decisions we make are based on the thoughts of all 33.\"\n\nAs the camera pans across the living area, some miners make victory signs and wave. But in contrast to the euphoria when the men were first contacted a week ago, some lie on makeshift beds, too tired to answer questions. \"Greetings to the family,\" says Esteban Rojas. \"Get us out of here soon, please.\" Another, Jony Barrios, tells his wife: \"Make sure the company pays my salary.\"\n\nAbove ground, family members in \"Camp Hope\" dragged chairs from the mess hall and used the side of a tent as a screen on Thursday night, watching in elation and anguish as the camera panned across the men's faces. \"They're giving us a lesson in survival,\" said Elizabeth Segovia, whose brother Dar\u00edo is one of the trapped men. \"They're well organised. They do look thin, but they look cheerful.\"\n\nThe video gives a glimpse of the men's cavernous living quarters: a two-kilometre stretch of tunnel. But it also gives an insight into the extreme conditions they must endure in the weeks to come. At one point the video focuses on a thermometer reading 29.5C (85F), and the sound of water running past the men's feet can be heard.\n\n\"The damp is our worst problem, so we're hoping you'll be able to sort this out,\" says Sepulveda, adding that the men are preparing to move to higher, drier ground.\n\nThe film ends with an emotional rendition of the national anthem as the camera pans over the face of each trapped miner.\n\nAbove ground, rescue workers are still assembling a giant drilling rig that is due to begin working this weekend. Today, the first of many expected lawsuits against the company that owns the mine and the government were filed and a judge ordered the retention of \u00a31.2m of company money in anticipation of the suits.", "image": "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/27/1282933521842/Image-grab-of-Mario-Gomez-006.jpg", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/27/trapped-chilean-miners-video1"}, {"published": 1282867200.0, "title": "How to keep the trapped Chilean miners alive", "body": "As 33 miners enter their third week trapped 688 metres underground, the logistics of keeping them alive has been reduced to a single dimension: 12cm.\n\n\"That's the size of the tube by which we can supply them,\" said the Chilean health minister, Jaime Ma\u00f1alich. \"Everything we develop must be this size or smaller.\" He described a laboratory of inventors behind the scenes designing everything from collapsible cots to miniature sandwiches for lunch.\n\nA tiny video camera lowered to the depths of the mine on Thursday showed the stark contrast between the men's cavernous living quarters \u2014 a two kilometer long stretch of mine tunnels, filled with vehicles and cave like crevices \u2013 and the nearly impossible task of providing them with anything more than the most basic sustenance.\n\nThe logistics of designing and sending supplies down a hole not much wider than a lemon has challenged engineers from Chile and from around the world as well as Nasa scientists and submarine commanders. The challenge of the rescue operation now is how to keep 33 trapped men healthy, sane and busy while a 40-tonne Australian-built drilling rig slowly rips open an escape tunnel.\n\nMedical literature has revealed little about managing such a crisis, Ma\u00f1alich said. \"The closest comparison is the submarine programme in which the submarines deliberately lay dormant at the bottom of the sea. That's why we have Captain Ramon Navarro, head of the Chilean submarine school, here.\"\n\n\"The submarine has the water outside, the miners have a 700-metre high column of rock, yet the sense of confinement is the same,\" said Navarro, looking out of place in the Atacama Desert with his stiff uniform and regulation cap. As he spoke, Navarro did little to hide pride for his fellow Chileans. \"If I am ever in a similar situation, I'd hope to have the resilience, the desire and the strength of spirit these miners have.\"\n\nThe miners do not appear to be in immediate danger: they began eating solid food on yesterday and are receiving water and handwritten messages from their families. Sets of dominos and other board games were sent down in an effort to stave off monotony and an evangelical priest arrived with a cache of tiny bibles. Special fluorescent tubes are being designed which will then be set on timers to create a sense of day and night in an attempt to keep the men on a normal schedule.\n\nMa\u00f1alich said his team was preparing for medical emergencies. \"How do you treat appendicitis without surgery? Our staff is scouring the old medical texts to find ways these kind of conditions can be treated without intervention, only using painkillers and other remedies.\"\n\nOne miner, Johny Berrios, has been designated doctor, and given the task of taking urine and blood samples which will be carefully placed in the tiny tubes and shot up to ground level where a makeshift laboratory has been built to analyse and monitor the health of each man. Miners with skin ailments or lesions will be asked to parade before the video camera, allowing a team of doctors to first diagnose the problem and then design a solution that fits inside a \"dove\", a carrying pod that passes through the hole.\n\nThe living conditions of the miners presents so many logistical and mental health issues that the support staff at this remote mine now includes 300 people, including engineers, psychologists, nutritionists, lab technicians and a detachment of Chilean carabineros. In total, there are roughly 10 professionals fully at work for each trapped miner.\n\nAfter a week of consultation with Nasa, a team of astronaut specialists will be brought to the mine to monitor the miners. Ma\u00f1alich appeared relieved by the swell of outside help and cited Nasa's expertise as key to maintaining the miners' physical and mental health intact for the ensuing 90 days. \"Nasa told us that we need to give them four litres a day of water, given the extreme heat and humidity.\"\n\n\"I would have to compare this to being trapped behind enemy lines or participating in a space mission,\" said Rodrigo Figueroa, one of Chile's leading psychiatrists who was brought in by the government. \"Really I have studied the medical literature and there are no similar situations like this, they simply don't exist.\"", "image": "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2010/8/27/1282939773434/Trapped-miner-in-Chile-006.jpg", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/27/33-trapped-chilean-miners-rescue"}, {"published": 1282867200.0, "title": "Video of trapped Chilean miners shows patriotism and humor", "body": "Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- The 33 men trapped deep in a mine in Chile since August 5 sent a video message to their families Thursday in which they expressed thanks for the efforts under way to free them and displayed occasional flashes of humor and patriotism.\n\n\"We know what you've all been doing for us,\" said one man. \"You haven't left us alone. We want to send applause to you.\" At that, the men broke into applause.\n\nThroughout the 25-minute, high-definition video, one miner guided the hand-held camera ahead of him, its path illuminated by the light on his mining helmet. The video views are grainy and sometimes out of focus.\n\nThe video shows the 50-square-meter living space occupied by the men since they were trapped 2,300 feet below ground. Some appear heavily bearded, all of them are stripped to the waist. A thermometer shows 29.5 degrees, (85.1 degrees Fahrenheit) a little cooler than officials had estimated.\n\nSome of the men are standing, others are lying down. \"Oh, you're sleeping on a box-spring bed,\" jokes one man to another, who is sprawled out on a pile of rocks.\n\nOn a crate sits a set of dominoes, on a wall are two first-aid boxes. Nearby are two stretchers.\n\nFor a few seconds, the camera lingers over a picture of a topless woman on the wall.\n\nIt is difficult to get an impression of how cramped the living quarters are because the camera showed no wide shots.\n\nAs the camera focuses on individual miners, some put their fingers up in a \"V\" for victory. Asked by the cameraman what they wanted to say, others appeared almost shy and simply smiled. One man put his hand to his face, apparently dazzled by the light.\n\n\"This is for my wife Lila, for my children and for my grandchildren,\" said Mario Gomez, 63, the eldest of the miners and the group's spiritual leader.\n\nSaid another to his family: \"Be calm. We're going to get out of here. And we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your efforts.\" At that, the other miners again broke into applause.\n\nThat theme was picked up by others. \"We're sure that there are people here in Chile that are big people, that are powerful people, that are intelligent people, and they have the technology and they will all work together to get us out of here,\" said another.\n\nThe tenor of most of the comments was calm, though one man's emotion cut through to the fore. \"Thank you to everybody,\" he said. \"I send you a big hug in the name of our Lord.\" As he spoke, his voice cracked.\n\nYet another miner praised his fellow inmates. \"We have had the great fortune that trapped in this mine there are good, professional people,\" he said. \"We have electricians, we have mechanics, we have machine operators and we will let you know that while you are working to rescue us on the surface, we are down here ready to help you too.\"\n\nOut of the view of the camera, as one miner finished his message, another could be heard saying, \"Get us out of here soon.\"\n\nThe video ends with the miners singing the Chilean national anthem. All appeared to be trying to hold their heads high. As they ended the song, they broke into chants of \"Chile! Chile! Chile!\"\n\nFamily members who saw the video in a private screening said their loved ones appeared thin, but healthy and in good spirits. Several said many of the relatives cried as they watched and listened.\n\nEarlier, officials had said the men were adopting various roles to help them through their ordeal. A shift leader at the San Jose copper and gold mine is fulfilling a leadership role and another man with nursing experience is carrying out basic medical and psychological tests.\n\nGomez, with more than 50 years' experience under his belt, has emerged as a spiritual leader on whom others can depend for support, officials said. He has asked that religious figurines be lowered into the mine so that he can set up a shrine.\n\nOne miner, an Elvis Presley fan, was expected to lead the group in singalongs.\n\nOfficials are splitting the men into two shifts so one group sleeps while the other works or has leisure time.\n\nDoctors have given the men advice about how to keep their limited living space clean: Portions of a 1-meter-high (3.3 feet), 40-meter-long shaft (131 feet) are being used as a latrine.\n\nIt is connected to the main 50-square-meter cabin, which is being used for sleeping, washing and praying.\n\nThe men's sole lifeline to the outside world is a tube approximately 8 centimeters (3.2 inches) in diameter, through which food, water, clothing, video and radio equipment and whatever else is needed are stuffed.\n\nHealth Minister Jaime Manalich told reporters Thursday that, on average, each man has lost 22 pounds (10 kilograms) since they became trapped three weeks ago, and dehydration remains a threat.\n\nBut a survey of the men indicates that at least nine miners are still too overweight to fit through the proposed rescue shaft, he said.\n\nInitially, the miners survived by draining water from a water-cooled piece of equipment. To stay hydrated in the 90-degree mine, each miner must drink eight or nine pints of water per day.\n\nWhat and how much the miners eat and drink is being monitored by officials.\n\nThe expected duration of the three- to four-month delay before their anticipated rescue has not been made clear to the miners. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera told the miners on Tuesday that they would not be out before September 18, Chile's independence day, but would be out before Christmas.\n\nHe told a Bolivian miner that he plans to meet in late November with Bolivia's president, and promised to invite the miner to accompany him.\n\nManalich passed along the president's remarks to reporters on Wednesday, speaking to them via speaker phone.\n\nBut authorities said it could be too much of a psychological blow to divulge to the trapped miners that the cramped space could remain their home until the end of the year.\n\nManalich said the president's comments were part of an ongoing effort to gently and methodically break the news that the rescue will take a long time.\n\nAsked why the miners weren't told specifically how long it will take, he replied, \"We don't have the correct psychological diagnosis about how the situation is down there.\"\n\nAnother survey found that three or four of the miners are showing signs of anxiety and depression, Manalich said.\n\nMeanwhile, recriminations have already begun. A lawsuit filed on behalf of 27 families of the trapped miners accused San Esteban Mining Co. of attempted murder.\n\nAnd lawyer Remberto Valdes said he was filing a suit on behalf of the family of trapped miner Raul Bustos alleging negligence by government officials in the nation's mining and geology service, Sernageomin, and against the owners of San Esteban Mining Co.\n\nBoth suits allege that the mining company violated state laws in failing to provide sufficient security.\n\nThe mine reopened in 2008 after a yearlong closure without the proper safety measures being put in place, including measures to shore up the rock face, Valdes said.

While no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, security experts told Reuters that it bore similarities to previous attacks by Islamic militants.\n\nAt least 10 of those killed in the Argana cafe overlooking the city's Djemma el-Fna Square were foreigners, according to the BBC. It is the first suicide attack since 2003, when suicide bombers killed 45 people, including themselves, in Casablanca. The square is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the top visitor spots in a country that relies heavily on tourism revenue \u2013 according to Reuters, it is the country's second largest industry, after agriculture.\n\nRecommended: Could you pass a US citizenship test?\n\n\"You can't find a more emblematic target than Jamaa-el-Fnaa square,\" a restaurant owner told the Guardian. \"With this attack and amid the worrying unrest in the region, tourism will hit the doldrums.\"\n\nThe North African Al Qaeda affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), is active in neighboring Algeria, but Morocco has been largely quiet since the 2003 attacks in Casablanca. A chief concern of the Moroccan government is that AQIM will eventually expand beyond Algeria and the Sahara desert and establish a base in Morocco, which it has so far failed to do, Reuters reports.\n\nGovernment spokesman Khalid Naciri was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that Moroccan security regularly halts terrorist plots and discovers terrorist cells.\n\nMoroccan authorities have rounded up thousands of purported terror suspects in recent years and while they \"regularly discover terrorist cells ... nothing led us to foresee an act of this magnitude,\" Mr. Naciri said. \"Morocco has an international image of welcome, hospitality and tourism,\" he said \"An act of this magnitude will leave its mark.\"\n\nThe government announced in January that it had arrested 27 suspected terrorists with links to AQIM in the southern region of the country. But a video appeared on YouTube last week featuring men claiming to be Moroccan members of AQIM and threatening to \"attack Moroccan interests,\" the Guardian reported.\n\nThe Casablanca attack in 2003 was the work of a local Islamic militant group and did not have ties to Al Qaeda, according to an analyst quoted by Reuters.\n\n\"Would-be attackers in Morocco are usually youths from deprived urban areas who have low terrorist capabilities and no connections with established groups,\" said Anna Murison of Exclusive Analysis. But several analysts said they suspected AQIM involvement in the latest bombing. U.S.-based corporate intelligence firm Stratfor said an attack on a soft target popular with tourists, as in the Marrakesh blast, \"fits AQIM's target set.\"\n\nThe bomb attack in Morocco highlights a key worry of both Western countries and Middle Eastern leaders attempting to tamp down terrorism in their countries: that the unrest and distraction caused by the region's prodemocracy movements is providing an opening for terrorist groups. The US is particularly concerned about Yemen, where Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is based.\n\nMorocco has been relatively stable the last couple months. In contrast to its North African neighbors, King Mohammed VI ceded to some of the protesters' demands for political reform quickly, bringing protests earlier this year to a quick end. However, the king does still retain final say on most government matters and the country's most prominent Islamist party is banned from the political process, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nNow there are concerns that the government could halt its reform efforts, which it would justify with the need for increased security in light of the Thursday attack \u2013 an excuse that many other Middle East autocrats have fallen back on.\n\nEarlier this week, thousands of Moroccans demonstrated, calling for further political reforms before the new constitution (a concession made by the king earlier this year) is presented in June, according to CNN. They disagree with the new constitution because it was crafted by a group of people designated by the king.

There were unconfirmed reports that one of the dead was a British tourist.\n\nIf the bombing is the work of Islamists, it will be their first major attack in Morocco since 2003, when a spate of suicide bombings in the commercial capital, Casablanca, killed more than 45 people.\n\nAt around 11.50am the blast ripped through the second story of a cafe overlooking Marrakech's Jamaa-el-Fnaa square, the most popular tourist spot in the old imperial city at the foot of the Atlas mountains.\n\nThe Argana cafe, lauded in guidebooks for its panoramic view, was blown apart by the force of the explosion, its second storey reduced to mangled wreckage. Witnesses described the blast sending people flying from their chairs.\n\nThe square, normally full of tourists and local vendors and storytellers, was swept up in panic as ambulance crews recovered dismembered bodies from the debris. A photographer described \"shredded bodies\" being pulled from the cafe. There were gruesome injuries at the city's main hospital, where at least 20 wounded were being treated.\n\nBoris Thiolay, a journalist for the French weekly L'Express who was in the square at the time, described a deafening explosion. \"We all jumped, then we saw a plume of black smoke rise above the restaurant and the souk.\"\n\nA local hotel worker told France-Info she heard a great boom and everything in the square suddenly went grey.\n\nThere were conflicting accounts of how the attack took place. One witness who escaped unharmed told Agence France Presse that a man had entered the cafe and ordered an orange juice before blowing himself up minutes later. Others said a bomber dropped a suitcase before walking out of the building.\n\n\"I heard a massive blast. The first and second floors of the building were destroyed,\" one local woman told Reuters. \"Some witnesses said they had seen a man carrying a bag entering the cafe before the blast occurred.\"\n\nThe Moroccan interior ministry said early evidence collected from the scene confirmed it was a bomb attack. Other local officials said indications were of a suicide attack and traces of nails were found in one of the bodies at the hospital. Initially, within moments of the explosion, officials had blamed a gas canister catching fire.\n\nEleven of the dead were believed to be tourists, around half were women and at least six were French, according to Moroccan television. The Elys\u00e9e confirmed that many of the dead and injured were French.\n\nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy condemned a \"hateful, cruel and cowardly attack\".\n\nAn unconfirmed report on Le Figaro's website claimed a couple from Marseille were among the dead, as well as one Briton.\n\nMarrakech is Morocco's top city-break destination and the blast came during French school holidays and at the start of the UK's extended bank holiday.\n\n\"You can't find a more emblematic target than Jamaa-el-Fnaa square,\" said one restaurant owner in the city.\n\n\"With this attack and amid the worrying unrest in the region, tourism will hit the doldrums.\"\n\nThe Moroccan government did not say whether the attack was thought to have been carried out by Islamists. In January, the Moroccan interior ministry said 27 suspected terrorists recently arrested in the south of the country had links to al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, a regional offshoot of the group. Last week, men claiming to be Moroccan members of al-Qaida's north African wing appeared in a video posted on YouTube threatening to attack Moroccan interests.\n\nTwo weeks ago the king, Mohammed VI, pardoned or cut the sentences of 190 detainees, including Islamists and Sahrawi political prisoners, as part of his promised concessions on rights and judicial independence.\n\nLast month he announced political changes and promised constitutional reform in an attempt to stave off a knock-on effect from the Arab popular uprisings that have overthrown Tunisia's dictator and Egypt's autocratic regime.\n\nSince 20 February, there have been three nationwide mass demonstrations for democracy and equality in Morocco, which is plagued by massive social injustice and a growing gap between the rich and the very poor.\n\nThe Marrakech blast is likely to hurt Morocco's tourist trade, a major source of revenue, which is already struggling to recover from the effects of the global downturn.\n\nMorocco's main stock exchange, the Casablanca bourse, was down 3.3% by early afternoon.\n\n\"People are panicking,\" said a trader on the bourse. \"This is a terrorist act and it will affect the economy and tarnish the country's image.
